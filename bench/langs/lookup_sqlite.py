"""The same lookups, against a DURABLE, transactional store.

THIS FILE EXISTS BECAUSE `lookup.py' IS NOT A FAIR PARTNER FOR THE STORE
LANES. A Python dict is memory: it is not durable, it is not
transactional, no second process can read it, and it disappears when the
interpreter exits. cocolog's `--embed' and server arrangements are a
database -- rows that survive the process, a turn that commits or does
not, and a second process that can read what the first wrote. Comparing
those to a dict measures the guarantees, not the engine, and the
comparison flatters Python for offering less.

So the state-machine table pairs them with the nearest thing every Python
already has: sqlite3, a file on disk, an index on the key, and the build
committed as one transaction. That is a real database against a real
database.

One difference stayed, and was the point rather than a flaw: SQLite's
PRIMARY KEY builds an index, and cocolog had no clause indexing -- it
tried clauses in order. It has a first-argument index now, so this pair
is an index against an index.
