# Working on cocolog

README.md says what cocolog is, STATUS.md what is proven, MODULES.md and
modules/README.md how a module is written. This file says how to work in here
and what will bite you. The long record of measurements, samples and refuted
readings that used to live here is in git: `git show 2fe74df:CLAUDE.md`
(through 1.8.35). Keep this file to what a session needs to work; a finding's
full story goes in its commit message or STATUS.md.

## The owner's standing rules

* **Ask before running the full suite (`make test`), a gate, or a whole
  tutorial run.** Name the command and roughly what it costs, then wait.
  Prove a change with narrow goals (`cocolog -s test/run.pl -- NAME`, a
  one-goal query, one section) unless told otherwise.
* **Commit or push only when asked.** Push with
  `git push git@github.com:saman-pasha/cocolog.git master:master`.
* **Every binary is built in release mode** (owner, 2026-10-08): Cicili's
  `--release` (`-O3`, plus `-falign-loops=32` for C) for the interpreter,
  the embedded store, every module and the `test/*.cicili` binaries, and
  `-O3` for anything compiled by hand (the `hoot` fixture). Cicili's
  default is `-g -O0`; nothing that runs a test or a measurement is built
  that way.
* **Every build and every configuration uses clang, never gcc** (owner,
  2026-10-08): cocolog, ZiguratIP, every module and library, and the Parsi
  objects in `$ZIGURATIP_HOME/ld`, whose compiler is `COMPILER/CPP` in
  `ziguratip.conf` (it said `c++`, which is g++ on Ubuntu, and all 111
  objects there were gcc's until they were rebuilt with clang that day).
  Check a build by its own objects: `readelf -p .comment` on a clang object
  names clang; the `GCC:` line every binary also carries is the system's
  `crtbeginS.o`.
* **Never commit build output**: `.o`, `.so`, the C/C++ Cicili emits, the
  `sdk.cicili`/`zigheaders` symlinks in `modules/*`. The test is to delete
  everything a `build.sh` makes and run it: what comes back was output.
* **A module comes only from a C/C++ API**, declared in a Cicili binding and
  called as Cicili -- never C or C++ pasted into `(code "...")` (see the
  Cicili section).
* **A new library gets a tutorial in the same commit**
  (`tutorials/library/NN-name.pl`).
* **`modules/ray` changes are validated by `cocolog -s test/ray.pl`** (and its
  tutorial if the surface changed); CivV's suite exercises it downstream.
* **`library/` must not change while a teach, learn or control round runs.**
  A teach consults the library once; a round compares libraries by md5.
* **Never `rm -rf $ZIGURATIP_HOME/data/*` unless `pgrep ziguratip` prints
  nothing** (see Hazards).
* **No Python is needed to build or run cocolog** (owner, 2026-10-01).
  Python appears only as the benchmark's yardstick (`bench/langs.sh`,
  `test/langs.pl`). `library(numpy)` still embeds CPython and is to be
  rewritten without it, on a C++ array library, keeping its `np_*`
  predicates and `.npy` files; until then it is opt-in (`WITH_NUMPY=1` in
  the install scripts and the Dockerfile). torch's and tensorflow's pip
  paths and `colab/` are left as they are for now. **Where a Python is
  used, its floor is NumPy's: 3.9** (`PY_MIN` in `install/common.sh`, the
  same check in `modules/numpy/build.sh`), and `WITH_NUMPY=1` makes the
  NumPy (1.26 or later) `python3`'s own -- a distribution's NumPy built for
  another Python than `python3` is not importable, the mismatch a box with
  `python3` at 3.11 and Ubuntu's NumPy at 3.12 had.

## The repositories

**Only this repository may be modified.**

| repo | role | last seen |
|---|---|---|
| `../cicili` | the language cocolog is written in; BUILD time | `9d74a5e` (3.0.0: a float literal is a double, every digit of it; 2.0.1 and 2.0.2 let `->` and `=>` through any call; 2.0.0 split `(inline)` and `(weak)`, which 1.10.7's reader needs) |
| `../ZiguratIP` | the database; RUN time and `make schema` | the owner's |

**cicili is frozen**: no edits, commits, pushes, branch changes or `git add`.
A problem that traces to the transpiler gets a diagnosis and a proposed patch,
not an applied one (the owner let four in by name: 2.0.0's split, 2026-10-11,
2.0.1's and 2.0.2's arrow through a call and 3.0.0's double literals,
2026-10-12).
The SHA above is an observation, not a pin -- the owner moves cicili; check it
with `git -C ../cicili log --oneline -1` when a build behaves oddly, and
correct the row rather than trusting it.

**ZiguratIP is the owner's.** It was unfrozen for engine fixes
(`TCP_NODELAY`, the unmap resume mark, rollback-on-disconnect, the streams
guard's writer preference, the page list, the chunked grow, the commit clock
settle, the open's hexmap read a page at a time -- 1.0.1). After touching
it: rebuild it, then `make schema` here. A change to
`MVCCS-cicili/mvccs-lib.cicili` also rebuilds cocolog's embedded engine,
transpiled from the same file through the `embed/mvccs-lib.cicili` symlink.
`make schema` writes cocolog's Parsi objects into `$ZIGURATIP_HOME/ld` and
the server writes `$ZIGURATIP_HOME/data`; neither dirties the ZiguratIP repo,
so `git status` in it should stay empty -- verify that it does.

## Build

```sh
export CICILI=/path/to/cicili                    # a Cicili checkout, for sbcl
export ZIGURATIP=/path/to/ZiguratIP              # a BUILT ZiguratIP checkout
export ZIGURATIP_HOME=$ZIGURATIP/home
make              # the client and the ONE cocolog binary, embedded store linked in
make EMBED=0      # the same binary without the embedded store: no ZiguratIP
                  # needed, --embed refuses by name, everything else unchanged
make schema       # compile the Parsi objects into $ZIGURATIP_HOME, $ZIGURATIP/home
                  # unless set (and copy the emitted tables into
                  # $ZIGURATIP/MVCCS-cicili/generated/)
make modules      # every loadable module buildable here; SKIPPED, by name, for the rest;
                  # and library(flow/chart)'s tables (sh tools/flow/build.sh, git-ignored)
make test         # the suite -- ask first
make lint FILES=x.pl            # cocolint over a file
make docker                     # BOTH images, every time (the owner's rule): cocolog with
                                # no optional part and no Python, and cocolog:ray-torch-numpy
make docker-save                # each as dist/*.tar.gz with dist/SHA256SUMS
sh tools/cloud/docker-build.sh  # the same two images on a Claude Code session's Linux box (below)
sh tools/lexicon/build.sh       # the reasoning lexicon from WordNet 3.0 (committed)
sh tools/tagger/train.sh        # regenerate generated/ and model.rows (committed)
```

* **`make` needs a BUILT ZiguratIP** unless `EMBED=0`: the embedded store is
  part of the binary and links `libCore` and `libStreamIO`. A missing checkout
  fails in Cicili with `FILE-DOES-NOT-EXIST … embed/mvccs-lib.cicili`, a
  symlink `embed/build.sh` made -- a stale one is not repaired by `make`;
  re-run the script or delete it.
* **Where `$HOME` is not where the checkouts are** (a container), set
  `CICILI` and `ZIGURATIP` explicitly; every `build.sh` defaults to
  `$HOME/cicili` and `$HOME/ZiguratIP`.
* **Debian's SBCL 2.2.9 starts with a 1 GB heap, which a build of cocolog
  exhausts** (a heap-exhaustion report from Cicili, midway). Since 1.10.28
  `tools/cc/sbcl` is the `sbcl` every build step runs (the Makefile's Cicili
  step, `env.sh` for each `build.sh`, `test/run.pl`): it hands the real
  sbcl 4096 MB when its default is smaller (`COCO_SBCL_HEAP=N`; a
  `--dynamic-space-size` given is obeyed). **It must not take `tools/cc`
  off PATH** for the sbcl it runs, as the wrappers do before they exec the
  compiler: the Cicili inside compiles by naming `gcc`, and its first
  version built cocolog with Ubuntu's gcc (the tell, `readelf -p .comment
  .libs/cocolog.o`).
* **Everything is built by clang** -- the client, the interpreter, the
  embedded store, every module, ZiguratIP's libraries and server, and the
  Parsi objects the server loads -- because cocolog links ZiguratIP's C++
  and `dlopen`s modules into one address space, and the owner's rule says so.
  `tools/cc/` is the answer (`tools/cc/README` the long version):
  - Cicili names `gcc` (and on Darwin `clang`) outright and takes no
    override, so the build puts `tools/cc` first on PATH, where shims hand
    over to the two wrappers, `cc` and `cxx`, and the wrappers take
    `tools/cc` off PATH before they exec the compiler by name
    (`coco_path_off`). Until 2026-10-15 only the Darwin shims took it off,
    and every compile by `gcc`, `g++` or a module's `$CC`/`$CXX` went
    through a wrapper twice, each flag twice -- the objects byte for byte
    the same. `tools/cc/env.sh` does it for a shell; `test/run.pl` does it
    for the test binaries.
  - `clang++` alone borrows libstdc++ from the newest gcc it finds, which may
    have no headers (`'string' file not found`); `tools/cc/cxx` passes
    `--gcc-install-dir`.
  - **On x86-64 both wrappers pad every jump off a 32-byte boundary**
    (`-mbranches-within-32B-boundaries`, from `coco_arch_flags` in
    `compiler.sh`, on a command that compiles and never on a link alone),
    the owner's choice of 2026-10-08 -- see Measuring. ZiguratIP's and
    coco's copies of `tools/cc` do not do it yet.
  - `CICILI_CC`/`CICILI_CXX` choose WHICH clang (Apple's, `clang-18`); the
    install scripts refuse a compiler that is not clang.
  - **The Parsi objects take their compiler from `ziguratip.conf`**
    (`COMPILER/CPP`, `clang++` now), not from `tools/cc`: `make schema`,
    ZiguratIP's System and demo objects and coco's all go through it, and
    `parsi/build.sh` compiles with a `clang++` copy of a configuration that
    names anything else (ZiguratIP's committed one said `c++`). parsi
    leaves each object's generated C++ in `home/tmp` and its two command
    lines at the head of the `.out` beside it, which is how the objects
    were rebuilt as they stood.
* **`sudo sh install/install-linux.sh` installs the packages as root and
  runs the rest as the calling user**, in that user's home: Quicklisp and
  `~/common-lisp` are found through `$HOME`, which sudo makes `/root`.
* **`?=` does not work for `CC`/`CXX`**: make gives them built-in values of
  origin `default`. Test `ifeq ($(origin CXX),default)`. The tell is
  `readelf -p .comment` naming gcc.
* **Cicili treats compiler chatter as FATAL**, so every target carries
  `-Wno-parentheses-equality` and `-Wno-dangling-else` in its own
  `:compile` list (the transpiler emits `while ((x == 0))` and unbraced
  else-if chains); C++ targets add `-std=gnu++17` (Apple clang defaults to
  C++14) and `-Wno-deprecated-declarations` (Apple marks `sprintf`). The
  error is an `Unhandled SIMPLE-ERROR` whose text is a warning.
* **Docker on a Claude Code session's Linux box**: `make docker` does not work
  there as it stands. `sh tools/cloud/docker-build.sh [plain|full|both]` builds
  the same two images under the same tags from this Dockerfile, which it
  derives a copy of and never edits, and smoke-tests them with no network
  (`smoke IMAGE` runs the checks alone, `save` makes `make docker-save`'s
  tarballs; its header has the whole story). What bites:
  - **The daemon is not running at the start and dies with the VM**, which
    restarts at every idle gap between turns and takes a build with it: keep
    the turn active while one runs.
  - **The only way out is the session's HTTPS proxy and its CA**
    (`/root/.ccr/README.md`), and **both change at every restart**; the script
    reads them live. A container cannot reach the proxy, so the build is
    `--network host`, and **the auto-mode safety check refuses that as a
    containment escape until the owner says so in the chat** ("go-ahead for
    docker build --network host", 2026-10-01): ask first, never retry it in
    pieces.
  - apt goes over https through the proxy, and Quicklisp (HTTP only) is
    replaced by a stand-in that loads the Lisp libraries of the box's
    `~/common-lisp`: the one way the image differs from a Mac's.
  - A container that runs `xvfb-run` (the ray case) needs `docker run
    --init`: as PID 1 the script waits for ever for the X server, and the case
    never starts.
  - The plain image takes 6 minutes with apt's cache warm and is 1.24 GB; the
    full one 9 minutes and 3.05 GB.
  - **A release's images come from the `Docker images` workflow**
    (`.github/workflows/docker-image.yml`), which the owner starts by hand
    (Actions, Run workflow; inputs `tag`, `ref`, `attach`): on a GitHub runner
    it runs `make docker-save`, smoke-tests both images with no network and,
    with `attach` on, uploads them to the DRAFT release of the tag. **The box
    cannot make, edit or publish a release, or attach a file to one** (HTTP
    403, "not permitted for this session type"): the owner makes the draft,
    pastes its notes and publishes it. The tag is made at that publish, at the
    tip of master, so master stays still from the build to the publish (the
    `publish` job refuses a moved target). Prove a changed workflow with a run
    with `attach` off. `COCOLOG_ROOT=DIR` with `SAVE=1` still builds a
    commit's images here, but they are a different build of the same source,
    not the release's files.
  - **Read an action's version from its repository, never from memory**: its
    `action.yml` at the tag names `runs.using` (`node24`).
    `download-artifact@v6` still ran on Node.js 20, and the first run's three
    notices named the `@v4` actions.

## The version

`cocolog --version` answers on stdout from ONE place, `coco_version_text` in
`cocolog.cicili` (a `#define` would be invisible to Cicili). **The patch is
the default**: bump it for every change to the binary or to a library other
than `library/reasoning/` (which has a number of its own, below), in the
same commit, never afterwards. A minor (something new reachable from a
program) or a major (a program that worked stopping) is PROPOSED with what
changed observably, and the owner takes it. **A documentation-only commit does
not bump** (there is no new binary for the number to describe); say "cocolog
stays X.Y.Z" in its message. `--help` goes to stderr. `test/argv.pl` pins the
shape of the answer, deliberately not the number.

**The reasoning library has a version of its own.** It carried cocolog's
number through 1.13.3 and has its own from there, starting at 1.0.0.
`reason_version/3`, a fact at the top
of `library/reasoning/reason.pl`, is the ONE place; `reason_version/1` answers
it as an atom (`'X.Y.Z'`). A change to anything under `library/reasoning/`
(the code, `corpus/`, `lexicon/`, `generated/`, `model.rows`) bumps THAT
number, in the same commit, and not cocolog's; a change to the binary or to
any other library bumps cocolog's; a commit that changes both bumps both. The
rules are the same ones: the patch is the default, a minor or a major is
PROPOSED and the owner takes it, a documentation-only commit does not bump
(say "reasoning stays X.Y.Z" in its message), and a message names the number
that moved (`reasoning 1.0.1`, `cocolog 1.13.4`). Before a bump read master's:
`git show origin/master:library/reasoning/reason.pl | grep -E '^reason_version\([0-9]'`.
`test/reason.pl` (section `version`, four arms red) and lesson 43 pin the
shape of the answer, deliberately not the number.

**Two lines of work bump the same number**: the owner's `master` and the
`reasoning-foundation` branch (the translator's sample loop) each spent
1.8.31 and 1.8.32 on different things, and the tree that joined them took
1.8.35. Before a bump, `git fetch` and read
`git show origin/master:cocolog.cicili | grep coco_version_text`; a bump taken
from the local value is a guess about where the other line has got to. A
merged tree that holds both lines' changes takes a number neither had. After
1.13.3 the sample loop's changes to `library/reasoning/` spend the reasoning
number, so the two lines meet on cocolog's only where both change the binary
or another library.

## Running a program

There is one binary; the knowledge-base arrangement is a runtime option:
`--local` (default), the server (`--kb`, `--host`, `--tcp [PORT]`, 2160),
`--tls [PORT]` (2160, binary protocol over TLS), `--http [PORT]` (80, Zeytun),
`--https [PORT]` (443), `--embed [DIR]` (`./KB` by default; a directory named
like a verb is written `./run`). There is no `--store`. `--port N` is a silent
alias for `--tcp N`; nothing in the tree spells it. `--tls` and `--https`
together are refused. TLS takes `--cacert`, `--capath`, `--cert`, `--key`,
`--key-pass`, `--insecure`.

* **`-s FILE` is `use_module(FILE), main`**, so the file's clauses are muted
  like any module's and never written through; **`run FILE GOAL` CONSULTS**,
  and consulting writes into the knowledge base. Under `--local` the two look
  identical; under a real store they are not. So are the writes of the goals
  an `-s` file's load runs (directives, `initialization(G)`), while
  `initialization(G, main)` is the program and writes through. A halt during
  any load commits what was written through before the process ends (the
  store's `on_halt`; until 1.8.57 it kept nothing). `-s` also puts
  `library(main)`'s `main/0` first where `run` puts the file's.
* **A program's own arguments come after `--`**:
  `current_prolog_flag(argv, [Exe|Tail])`; `os_argv` is the literal command
  line; `executable` is the binary's path. Those three, `double_quotes`,
  `text_units` (1.13.0) and since 2.0.0 `bounded`, `max_integer`,
  `min_integer`, `max_tagged_integer` and `min_tagged_integer` are the only
  flags answered. `library(main)` parses the tail.
* **Exit status is SWI's**: 0 proved, 1 failed silently, 2 threw; `halt(N)`
  is N from `-s`, `run` and `query` alike.
* **An error nothing caught is followed on stderr by its backtrace**
  (1.10.17; TRACING.md): `ERROR: In:`, the goal that raised, then each
  engine's goals left to run -- or, under `--backtrace` (trace 3, which
  prints nothing) or `--trace`, every call as `[Depth] Goal`. A load's
  directive and initialization reports carry one too. `--no-backtrace`
  turns it off; a case that holds stderr to the letter either takes the
  backtrace into what it expects or compares the message's lines alone
  (test/engine.pl, test/directives.pl's swipl diff).
* **Raise the server detached**, with its libraries on the path:

  ```sh
  export ZIGURATIP_HOME=$ZIGURATIP/home
  setsid env LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$ZIGURATIP_HOME/lib" \
    "$ZIGURATIP_HOME/bin/ziguratip" > /tmp/zig.log 2>&1 &     # Linux
  ./cocolog --kb main --host 127.0.0.1 --tcp 2160 --timeout 10 list   # check it
  ```

  A plain `nohup … &` from a tool call does not survive the turn. Without the
  library path it dies at once and every database case SKIPs. On macOS:
  `nohup` in a subshell and `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
  `ziguratip --config=<file>` runs a custom-configured server (TLS mode,
  ports, permissions) without touching `home/etc/ziguratip.conf`.

## The suite

`make test` is `./cocolog -s test/run.pl`; `-- NAME` runs one case. It builds
the seven `test/*.cicili` binaries through Cicili with `--release` (term,
syntax, solve, module, state, zigurat, shared; about forty seconds each that
links the engine) and runs the 63 `.pl` cases in `pl_names/1`
-- **70 lines**, each with its seconds. There is no `.sh` under `test/`.

* **A case is `test/<case>.pl`**, run as `./cocolog -s test/<case>.pl` from
  the checkout root with `COCOLOG_LIBRARY` naming this checkout's `library/`
  (the runner prepends it to whatever the caller exported). `main/0` runs the
  checks; `check/3` and `checks_done/0` are `library(process)`'s; **the exit
  code is the verdict**. A line beginning `SKIP` at column 0 skips the case; a
  skipped SECTION says so indented. `test/prelude.pl` has `answer/3`,
  `written/3`, `yes_no/2`, `skip/1`, `scratch/1`, `fixture/2`,
  `cocolog_out/2` and `spawn/2`. A check is a second process only when it
  genuinely must be (a consult's stderr, a store read back by another
  cocolog, a server, a goal that must be killable).
* **A spawned server must be `exec`'d** (`spawn/2` does it), or `proc_stop/1`
  kills the shell and orphans the server, which then holds its port for the
  next run.
* **Wait for a port with `lsof -iTCP:PORT -sTCP:LISTEN`**, never a probe
  connection: a server that accepts N times counts it, and `httpd`'s accept
  loop ends on a failed accept.
* **`proc_run/4`'s deadline is the monotonic clock's** (1.11.0). Through
  1.10.28 each poll was charged its whole 200 ms step though a poll with
  data waiting returns at once with one 4096-byte read: a child printing
  more than ~20 bytes per millisecond of its timeout was killed with 124,
  and `shell/3`'s two minutes held ~2.4 MB of output. A case that went red
  on a big output then is worth running again.
* **A clause has ONE scope**: suffix each check's variables with its number
  and never reuse a suffix. When a goal answers differently inside a clause
  than alone, look for a variable the clause already bound.
* **libc regex `.` matches a newline**: `answer\([^\n]*\)`, not `.*`.
* **`set_prolog_flag/2` is a directive**, not a goal; a case cannot put a
  flag back itself.
* **A section that ends with no red check and no verdict line is a goal that
  FAILED**: suspect a builtin answering 0 where it should raise, a
  `proc_run/4` timeout, or a fixture lesson that lacks a word.
* **The prelude's `shell/3` gives a child two minutes and a timed-out child
  hands back EMPTY output**, which a case reads as "nothing found". A step
  whose work grows with the tree takes `shell/4` with a ceiling of its own
  (`test/lint.pl`'s corpus lint has five minutes).
* **A container runs as root**, who writes through a mode of 444: a
  permission check skips by name when `os_uid/1` answers 0
  (`test/stream.pl`).
* **`red: 0` does not mean the suite passed.** Database cases SKIP rather
  than fail with no server -- `zigurat`, `shared`, `tunnel`, `tensors`,
  `zigurat-lib`, `kbs`, `zigurat-tls`, `groups`, `ruler` -- and others SKIP
  for a missing tool (`files` and `trace` want `swipl`, `ray` raylib and a
  live screen, `tensorflow`, `numpy`, `opencv` their libraries,
  `torch-replay` a CUDA toolkit). **Count the SKIPs and run
  `pgrep ziguratip`** before believing a green run; the number of SKIPs is a
  fact about the machine.
* **A red run of `test/translate.pl` prints two reports and only the first is
  true**: `main` fails, the engine backtracks into an earlier choice point and
  re-runs later sections over changed lessons. Read up to the first `RED`.
* **A case that passes alone proves the case; the suite proves the contract
  between cases** (a lesson's last line must be exactly `done`; a library
  loaded as a goal after a module set a flag).
* **A new C builtin wants a line in `library/flow/modes.pl`** (`flow_mode/4`,
  or `flow_test/2` for a test; and `flow_binds_all/2` when its success binds
  every argument whichever way it ran, as text made from text does -- ask
  the engine, `atom_length/2` takes any term), and `test/flowchart.pl` holds that table to
  `library/flow/tables.pl` -- generated, git-ignored, and rebuilt only by
  `make modules` (`sh tools/flow/build.sh`), so an old one passes the check:
  `acyclic_term/1` and `cyclic_term/1` (1.10.18) went through two regression
  nets that way, and the first full suite after them ended `red: 1`
  (1.10.19; the lines came in 1.10.20). Rebuild the tables before believing
  the case after adding a builtin.
* **A fixture that has to TAKE a while is timed by the clock, never by a
  count.** 1.8.42-1.8.44 made the engine two to three times faster and
  three cases went red for it alone: a cowork job that had to outlive a
  60 ms wait (it waits on an empty channel now), an httpd page that had to
  outweigh a request's fixed cost (timed in-process, sized to 400 ms), and
  `groups`, whose floor of turns caught fewer steps per proof as designed
  (group b moved to a goal with more search). An httpd page gets
  `page_limit` inferences, a million by default, and past them it is a 500
  -- the old slow page never finished, and nothing checked its answer: **a
  timed request checks its status too.** A change to the engine is gated
  with the modules built and a server up; `make EMBED=0` without them
  cannot run these three.
* `scratch/1` names `/tmp/coco_cocolog_test_PID_SEQ`, and `make_directory/1`
  FAILS (does not raise) on a name that is taken; leftovers in `/tmp` plus a
  recycled PID fail a section silently. Not fixed.
* **Before saying something works**, with the owner's go-ahead: `make test`
  with a server up, read every line, count the SKIPs. A change to the
  knowledge base also wants proving **across processes** -- one cocolog
  writing, a second that consulted nothing reading.

## Hazards, each of which has already cost a day

* **A slow suite is usually the server's uptime.** Restart the server first
  (two seconds; check `pgrep -fl 'cocolog -s test/'` so you break nobody's
  run). If a restart does not help, it is the store ageing: deleted rows stay
  under MVCC; `cocolog vacuum` reclaims them (`groups` and `ruler` vacuum in
  setup), or restart on a fresh `data/`.
* **A store wiped under a server that is still dying answers writes and keeps
  none.** `pgrep ziguratip` must print nothing before `rm -rf
  home/data/*`; a clean restart afterwards is the whole cure.
* **Rebuild the Parsi objects after ANY ZiguratIP engine build.** A stale
  `.so` in `$ZIGURATIP_HOME/ld` takes the server down with `symbol lookup
  error`. After an engine rebuild every object there is stale: ZiguratIP's
  `System/` and `demo/` objects, then `make schema` here.
  `nm -u home/ld/*.so` shows who is behind.
* **A red `contention_test` aborts ZiguratIP's `make` after the artefacts are
  built**, and is usually not yours: `writer under readers` is a harness coin
  toss, and a crash shows up a few times in 144 runs. Re-run before believing
  it. (macOS fails `rewrite vs index` -- a recorded, unfixed engine finding.)
* **An index changed in `parsi/01-schema.parsi` comes up EMPTY on a live
  server**, and a `forget` through it deletes nothing. Run `cocolog vacuum`
  right after the restart, before any base is touched. `--embed` rebuilds a
  new index from the rows at its next open.
* **A page and a procedure of the same name are ONE compiled object**, pages
  last; check `parsi/03-pages.parsi` before naming anything in
  `parsi/02-procedures.parsi`.
* **A store is in the writing machine's byte order** and does not travel;
  `byteorder.bin` beside it is checked before open, and a refusal exits 1
  with an empty stdout and the reason on stderr.
* **A clause must fit one page** (65536 on a store made since 1.10.0 and
  ZiguratIP 1.0.0, 8192 on an older one, ~8014 characters there): the store
  sets `clause_max = page - 190 - len(kb)` and `assertz/1` raises
  `resource_error(clause_length)`; a consult reports and goes on. Over the
  wire the client assumes 65536; `$COCOLOG_PAGE_SIZE` says otherwise (8192
  for an older server or store).
* **A writing process rewrites the whole predicate** (the backend flushes a
  dirty predicate wholesale, ~360 bytes of new store per EXISTING row) and
  the old rows stay dead; every later process is slower -- a predicate's
  first call walks its dead rows at ~0.2 us each (1.13.7: five appends of
  one lesson noun added ~10 ms to its 14-17). `cocolog vacuum` after the
  write bounds it. `garbage_collect/0` is unrelated: it compacts this
  process's cell array, not the disk.
* **The first call of a big predicate under `--embed` is a fetch of all
  its clauses**, ~12 k instructions a clause after 1.13.7 (the row walk
  6 k, the parse 4 k): 30-60 ms for a lesson predicate of 10-30 k
  clauses, ~600 ms of a 680 ms translation. Opening the store cost every
  process 0.3-0.7 s through ZiguratIP 1.0.0 (its open read the hexmap a
  byte a chunk); 0.06 s since 1.0.1.
* **An httpd pool fetches every module predicate per request** unless
  `prewarm/1` ran (`httpd_serve/3` calls it): pre-warm BEFORE spawning
  threads. `library(cowork)` deliberately does not -- the rule is the
  fetches recurring, not the threads existing.
* A base written before 1.2.18 can hold a module's own clauses beside the
  program's (duplicate solutions); `cocolog forget NAME ARITY` cleans one
  predicate.
* A `lock wait timeout` today means a LIVE contending writer (or a server
  older than the rollback-on-disconnect fix).

## Measuring

* **A within-run pair or nothing.** This box drifts ~20 % between runs of one
  build. Compare two builds in ONE round, back to back, and settle a few per
  cent with five alternating pairs; a ratio under ~3x from medians alone
  means nothing on the pooled rigs.
* **An inference count is not a clock, and a clock is not a count.** Count
  inferences (`statistics/2`, `call_metered/4`) to find a cost, time to
  confirm it; a lookup with its first argument unbound is one call in the
  count and every row in the time. **A count is comparable within one engine
  and not across two**: the engine of 1.8.47 counts 19.5 % fewer inferences
  than 1.8.43's for the same 1762 translations of the sample loop's controls
  (with every text the same; the compiled clause, the deterministic call and
  `is/2` came between them), so a baseline kept from an older binary is
  counted again on the new one.
* **What a step costs** (1.12.2, `statistics(inferences)` differences; the
  constructs are steps too): length/2, nth0/3 and nth1/3 with the index
  given, last/2, reverse/2 of a proper list and atomic_list_concat/2,3 are 1
  in every mode that answers once (C rows; through 1.12.1 a clause around
  '$len', '$nth0', '$rev', '$last' or '$atom_join'/3: 2 to 13), catch/3 that
  exits 3 (the catch, the goal, '$catch_exit'), nb_getval/2 1, and `true` and
  `=/2` NONE (the two clocks, below). A window of 100 000 steps of the
  translator (1.11.4): `true/0` 4.1 %, `=/2` 4.2 % -- no inferences since --
  `atom/1` 3.7 %, `=../2` 3.7 %. A rewrite that removes steps changes the
  count much more than the clock (-32 % and -9.6 % above); ask the clock.
* **When fewer instructions buy no time, count the jumps on 32-byte
  boundaries.** On Skylake's descendants (this box's Cascade Lake, the
  owner's Mac's Coffee Lake) the JCC erratum's microcode keeps a jump that
  crosses or ends on one out of the decoded-uop cache. 1.9.1's naive
  reverse ran 12 % fewer instructions in the same time, with 26.6 such
  jumps an inference against 1.9.0's 16.2; padded, 0.02, and 20 % faster
  (STATUS.md). The count: `callgrind --dump-instr=yes --dump-line=no`
  self counts per address against `objdump -d`'s jump addresses. There are
  no hardware counters in this VM (no `cpu` event source; the `msr` one has
  only `tsc` and `smi`).
* **A count compared across two builds carries the padding's no-ops.** Any
  change moves the functions after it and the padding inside them:
  1.10.12's first build ran `coco_try_clause`, not touched, with two more
  instructions an inference, all of them `nop` and `xchg %ax,%ax`.
  `sh tools/flow/zero.sh OLD NEW` counts nrev, queens and lookup with the
  padding apart; a function's own count, per function, is the same parse
  (its header). And a source change in the step loop moves the loop's
  register allocation whatever it says (DESIGN-flow.md 9.1).
* **Find a cost with the hunk bisection**: take each hunk of the diff against
  the last version out in a copy of the library and count the sentences that
  rose, several copies at a time (counts do not depend on load). A hunk that
  removes a helper other hunks call answers with an error -- no evidence.
* **One rule, one arm.** A fix that lands in the same edit as another has not
  been measured; a change that moves nothing measurable is not shipped. Arm by
  RULE, a group of hunks: a rule split over two hunks (a head variable and a
  body one) is green with either out. A section cannot arm a rule whose check
  lives in another: run the whole case on that arm (a front's `that` clause
  was green in its own section and red in the Ciampi one).
* **Print the md5 of the library under test AND compare it** to the expected
  one, before the first pass and after the last; a round whose two md5s
  differ is void. Revert with `git checkout -- .`, never by naming files.
* **`utime` beside `stime`, never summed** (`/proc/PID/stat` fields 14 and
  15). On the four-vCPU Linux box a cross-vCPU wakeup is a VM exit costing
  ~18 µs (idle vCPUs halt, no haltpoll): a pooled or threaded figure there
  that is system time tracking the `RES` row of `/proc/interrupts` is a fact
  about the microVM, not the engine.
* **A per-call rate is not a volume**; measure the count before building a
  fix on a rate.
* **`pgrep -f`/`pkill -f` match the shell running them.** Match with
  `pgrep -x cocolog` and `/proc/PID/cmdline`, skip `$$`/`$PPID`, and prefer a
  waiter whose condition is the process gone.
* **A knob that tests `!= nil` is ON when empty** (`MVCCS_NO_CACHE=`); use
  `${VAR:+NAME=1}`.
* `contention_test` opens a filebuf store; `STORE_MAP=1` is the path `--embed`
  and the server use. `MVCCS_DEBUG=warn|info|debug sh MVCCS-cicili/build.sh`
  compiles the engine's trace points in (`guard HELD`, `draw STALLED`).
* **`statistics/2` is about the calling thread** (`store_used`, `store_cap`,
  `globalused`, `globalcap`, `trailused`, `trailcap`, `choicepoints`,
  `strings`, `compactions`, `heap_collections`, `cputime`, `inferences`,
  `atoms`, `functors`). Worker threads are invisible to it: count the
  threads first. On macOS `maximum resident set size` undercounts after a
  large realloc moves.
* `perf` is not installed on the Linux box; `/usr/bin/time` is not either
  (use bash's `time`).

## Cicili, as it is actually written

Cicili is Lisp-syntax C. `../cicili/doc/` is the reference (`DOC-C.md`,
`DOC-CPP.md`, `lib-std-c.md`), `../cicili/lib/README.md` the index. Read them
rather than guessing: a wrong guess usually compiles to something that fails
much later.

* **A string literal is raw** and reaches C untouched; it may not end in a
  backslash and cannot contain a newline (a module's Prolog half is joined
  with spaces).
* **A float literal is a double, every digit of it** (Cicili 3.0.0). Through
  2.0.2 the Lisp reader took it as a single float: `pi` and `e` answered
  `3.1415927` and `2.7182817` through cocolog 1.10.21, and numpy's
  `1e-300` guard was `0.0`. A macro that computes a float as it expands
  computes a double -- `(sqrt 2.0)`, never `(sqrt 2)`, which prints `f0`.
* **`break` and `continue` are bare symbols.** Use `bitand`, `bitor`, `xor`.
* **There is no character literal**: use the macros (`coco-ch-between`) or
  the code with a comment.
* **`defer` is an attribute of a `let`/`var` binding**, not a statement.
* **Lambda-list markers are uppercase** (`&REST`). **A macro emits ONE
  form**; several leave the symbols unregistered. **`new` is a macro.**
  **An attribute written before a macro that emits a function does not
  reach it**: `(static) (some-macro …)` came out without `static`, and the
  guards' runner emitted that way was called rather than inlined (the
  module dispatchers emitted by `coco-emit-module-dispatch` are not static
  either). Write the `func` with its attribute and let the macro make the
  body (`cc-guards-body`).
* **A function pointer in a variable is a `func` clause in type position**
  (`coco_store_reset` in `lib/kb.cicili`); a static one is
  `(static) (var func hook (ARGS) (out int) . nil)`. As a PARAMETER, the
  definition's list is `((func hook (ARGS) (out int)))` -- one level fewer
  closers than the declaration's `(decl) (func NAME ((func hook …)))`;
  copying the declaration's closers is `unmatched close parenthesis`, from a
  reader that names no line.
* **`for` takes a binding list and a parenthesised step**:
  `(for ((size_t i . 0)) (< i n) ((++ i)) BODY)`; a computed initialiser
  needs `#'`: `(for ((size_t i . #'($ r nvars))) …)`. The wrong form fails
  with `The value 0 is not of type SEQUENCE`.
* **`(out T *)`, not `(out (T *))`.** **A cast takes ONE type token**:
  `(cast u8 x)`, or mask with `(bitand (cast int c) 255)`.
* **A `let` declares locals; `block` does not.** **Indexing is
  `(nth INDEX ARRAY)`**; arrays have at most two dimensions.
* **A dotted initialiser `(var size_t n . 0)` cannot be written inside a
  generic** in this package (`nil` is `cocolog::nil`).
* **A `#define` is invisible to Cicili**: write the number out.
* **`$` chains** (`($ a b c)` is `a.b.c`), `(-> p m)` is `p->m`,
  `(=> o m args)` calls a function in a member. **The object of `->` and
  `=>` may be a call**: by name since Cicili 2.0.1,
  `(-> (coco_m_machine e) heap_len)`, and through a function pointer (a
  variable, a member, a table of them) or a C++ method since 2.0.2; through
  2.0.0 that was `pointer storage not found`, and
  `($ (cof (coco_m_machine e)) heap_len)` the way round it (the tree's
  last two went in 1.10.21). A callee whose type Cicili
  cannot resolve -- a type known only by a `@define` -- still has none:
  dereference it.
* **`../cicili/lib/std/c/posix/` already declares the POSIX structs**; what
  is missing is only the C typedef: `(@define (code "pollfd struct pollfd"))`,
  named exactly as std names it.
* **`(code "...")` is the fire escape, not the door** -- C that Cicili cannot
  see. A `;` inside one makes an empty statement (the emitter adds its own),
  which breaks an `if`/`else`. `@ifdef` takes `(code "__APPLE__")`.
* **A file compiled on its own has no `DEFPACKAGE`** (it expands to an
  `EVAL-WHEN` Cicili then reads: `unknown symbol: EVAL-WHEN`).
* **A C library is declared in a binding and called as Cicili.** A
  `(decl) (struct Color (member uchar r) …)` inside a binding's `init-macro`
  emits NOTHING and teaches inference the shape -- how `lib/std/c/posix`
  declares `sockaddr_in` and `lib/net/curl.cicili` libcurl. Worked examples:
  `modules/ray/binding.cicili`, `modules/clay/binding.cicili` (by-value
  structs, `'{ 0 }` initialisers, `(typedef int …)` enums, static struct
  arrays).
* **A C++ library is ONE Cicili file with `(make :cpp #t :compile #f)`**,
  every call and type a Cicili clause over a binding under Cicili's
  `lib/cpp/<lib>/` (a package plus an `init-macro` that emits nothing):
  `lib/cpp/opencv`, `lib/cpp/zigurat`, `lib/cpp/torch`, `lib/cpp/dl`. The
  SDK prototypes are declared RAW inside `extern "C"` before `(coco-sdk)` --
  otherwise C++ mangles them and `use_module` fails with
  `undefined symbol: _Z11coco_m_text…`; the entry and dispatcher sit in
  `(extern-c …)`. Wrapping `(coco-sdk)` in `(extern-c …)` is not the fix.
* **`(inline)` inlines, `(weak)` is weak** (Cicili 2.0.0, `8be7385`):
  `(static) (inline)` emits `__attribute__((always_inline)) static inline`,
  and `(weak)` `__attribute__((weak))` -- what `(inline)` emitted through
  1.0.1: one definition however many files instantiate it, a call clang never
  inlines, and with `(static)` no C at all (`weak declaration cannot have
  internal linkage`). A helper two hot callers share and clang leaves out of
  line is an `(inline)` (the reader's three, 1.10.7).
* **The macro tables emit several things that must not drift apart**
  (`*cell-tags*`, `*operators*`, `*builtins*`, `*turn-outcomes*`,
  `*construct-names*`): **add to the table, never to the generated code.** A
  construct name missing from `*construct-names*` stops the build at
  `no dispatch id`.

## Parsi

`IF cond BEGIN … END`; `<>` for not-equal; names fold to upper case (a column
named `text` collides with the `Text` type, hence `body`); a row must fit one
page (machine state travels in 4000-byte chunks).

## Libraries and modules

**Tier 1 is always present, and `use_module` on it is a no-op nobody here
writes**: the compiled-in `apply builtins dcg files library lists zigurat`
and SWI's own `assoc pairs ordsets yall aggregate ugraphs dcg_basics
dcg_high_order`, vendored unmodified in `lib/swipl` and read at start-up (do
not edit them). Only files swipl also runs (`test/files/*.pl`,
`emacs/test/conformance.pl`) and `test/library.pl` keep such a directive,
where cocolint reads it acknowledged (`% cocolint: T1 -- ...`, below).

**Tier 2 is loaded when asked**, from `$COCOLOG_LIBRARY` (colon-separated),
then `./library`, then `<exedir>/library`, then `<exedir>/lib/swipl` -- the
path is anchored to the binary, so an installed cocolog loads its own
libraries. `library/*.pl` are clauses only (http, httpd, websocket, json,
xml, html, ca, kbs, cowork, main, astar, hex, clay_ray, tensor_expr, llm,
and `library/reasoning/` and `library/flow/`: `flow/chart` and
`flow/debug`, each with its parts beside it, `dbg*.pl` the debugger's);
`library/*.so` are modules built from `modules/`. A file whose first line
reads `%% library(NAME), part: ...` is loaded by its library, and the
cocolint index offers no import of it.

**`modules/` holds the loadable modules**, one directory each -- a
`.cicili`, a `build.sh` (`sh modules/NAME/build.sh`), output nobody commits
-- and **none of them is part of `make`**:

| needs nothing | `tcp` `thread` `process` `text` `os` `clay` (Clay vendored, one header) `stream` |
|---|---|
| a BUILT ZiguratIP | `sha` `aes` `der` (libEncoding only) `x509` `tls` `bigint` |
| an external library | `curl` (libcurl), `torch` (libtorch), `tensorflow` (its C API), `ray` (raylib), `numpy` (python3 with numpy and a shared libpython), `opencv` (OpenCV 4 with dnn) |

* **A module holds the engine as an OPAQUE pointer** (`coco_m_new_int e V`,
  never `(-> e m)`). Its entry is `coco-deflibrary`, or for C++ a
  hand-written `coco_library_entry` inside `extern "C"`.
* **What a `coco_m_*_error` returns is the predicate's ANSWER (2: the
  continuation is set), not a status.** A guard written
  `(if (not (helper …)) (return 0))` tests `not 2` and walks on with a ball
  in flight. Pass it through --
  `(let ((int rc . #'(ray_iarg e g 0 (aof x)))) (if (!= rc 1) (return rc)))`
  -- or have the helper answer 0 and carry the raise out in a parameter.
  The tell is a helper that both raises and returns int.
* **A handle is an integer index into the module's own table** (tcp, tls,
  ray, stream), so losing one leaks what it names silently. Probe by
  exhausting the table before and after the code you suspect.
* **`$`-prefixed names must be QUOTED in a module's Prolog half**
  (`'$x509_issue'`), or the half "would not consult".
* **Which library holds a symbol is not guessable, and a miss links fine**:
  `nm -D --defined-only` over `home/lib`, and name every transitive
  dependency on the link line.
* **`current_predicate/1` answers about the PROGRAM**, not the library or
  modules: probe a module by catching `existence_error` around a real call.
  It answers for a predicate with a clause or a dynamic declaration, as
  SWI's does -- consulted, asserted, or read from a file the program loaded
  by its path (`-s FILE`, `ensure_loaded/1`, `use_module/1` of a file: a
  module whose predicates are `own`, beside the `library` flag the pre-warm
  needs; 1.10.28, until which they were left out with the library's, and
  `listing/0` too). SWI answers for a library's and a builtin's as well;
  this does not. Through 1.10.2 it also answered for any name a call or
  `clause/2` had merely looked up (each makes a table entry).
  `predicate_property/2` (1.10.28) answers for a construct (by name AND
  arity, `*callable-constructs*`: the construct table also holds the
  engine's markers, `'$k'`, `[]`, `:-`, which are no predicates), a C
  builtin of the engine or of a compiled-in module (`built_in`, `foreign`,
  from the tables the dispatchers are built from: `coco-emit-claims`), and
  any predicate of the store (`dynamic`/`static`, `number_of_clauses/1`,
  `number_of_rules/1`); `M:H` is H, so `user:H` walks the program's. A
  `.so` module's predicates are not answered, and a library's carry no
  `built_in`/`imported_from` (a muted consult records no file).
* **Register modules before spawning threads**: the registry is
  process-wide and unguarded.
* `cocolint`'s index picks `modules/NAME/NAME.cicili` by name; a header
  signature list counts only at column 0.
* **The whole tree lints clean, and `test/lint.pl` holds it to that**
  (2.2.1): every `.pl` it holds, no finding HARD or WARN, and no `thin` or
  `unrouted` note from the index. A form a file commits on purpose (a lesson
  teaching the trap) carries `% cocolint: ID -- why` on its line, or alone
  on the line before; U1 reports one whose finding has gone or that gives no
  reason, and `COCO_LINT_NO_ACK=1` reads none. `lib/swipl/` is not read.
  Lint a new or changed `.pl` before a commit: `sh tools/cocolint/lint.sh
  FILE.pl`.
* **The dialect card cites engine lines by range** (`tools/cocolint/
  traps.jsonl`). An edit ANYWHERE above a cited site moves it; a cite whose
  anchor is unique is accepted as moved, one whose anchor repeats in its file
  is refused until its range is corrected. After touching `lib/` or
  `cocolog.cicili`, run `sh tools/cocolint/tool.sh card --check`.

## The engine: what is not obvious

* **Dispatch is construct, C builtin, module, store, by name AND arity.** A
  C-registered name shadows any clause of that name (`listing/1` shows
  nothing). Grep a predicate name before writing it: **cocolog consults the
  clauses of one name that are not together in the file without a word**
  (SWI warns; cocolint does not), so a helper given an existing name joins
  that predicate. library(flow/chart) names each such predicate it charts
  (the `discontiguous` finding, 1.10.27), and as an error one DEFINED TWICE
  -- a clause that repeats an earlier run's, or a head an earlier run's
  fact covers (`defined_twice`, 1.10.28): the translator has 38 and none
  (`tr_cap_run/3` was the one, until 1.11.1). The flow chart takes `load(Files)` for a program's other
  files, whose predicates then count as defined (`load=` on
  tools/flow/chart.pl), and `progress(S)` (stderr, every S seconds, 10 from
  the command).
* **Every builtin is deterministic**, so a failure-driven loop written from
  habit (`retract(H), fail`) runs ONCE -- wrong, not slow. `once/1`,
  `ignore/1` and `\+` are control constructs. So `arg(N, f(a, b), A)` with
  `N` unbound and `char_type(C, alpha)` with `C` unbound RAISE where SWI
  enumerates. A module row that must enumerate for some arguments ends in
  `:declines` (1.12.0, `coco-emit-module-dispatch`): its function takes
  `found` and turns those goals down (`coco_m_decline`) to a clause of its
  Prolog half -- nb_current/2 with its key unbound.
* **The trail carries VALUE ENTRIES since 1.12.0** (setarg/3): two words,
  both with bit 63 (`coco-trail-pair`), the cell holding the old value and
  then the cell it goes back into; `coco_undo_to` puts it back, the
  collector marks every saved cell and keeps or drops a pair whole (by the
  restored cell, as a binding by its variable), a freeze writes the words
  as they are. **A new reader of the trail tells a pair from a variable**,
  and reads a pair's cell under bit 40 (`coco-trail-cell`): bits 40 to 62
  (`coco-trail-tag`) are 0 in a value entry and not in a ground global's
  sentinel (1.12.1, below) -- the global's index plus one, the copy's
  serial, cell 0 in both words, which the undo writes with itself.
  nb_setarg/3 writes past the trail and RAISES MARKS instead
  (`coco_heap_freeze`, SWI's freezeGlobal): every choice point's, nested
  engine's and host's registered heap mark above the written cell goes to
  the heap's length, so its copy outlives backtracking -- **a new starter
  of a nested engine that winds the heap back reads its mark back from the
  engine (`pheap`)**, as findall/3 does (a window's question carries the
  window's mark in its engine's `pheap` and hands it back, 1.12.1), or that
  copy is cut away under the cell. The marks grow up a choice stack and
  inward along the chain, so the walk stops at the first one below. The argument
  CELL is written: a body's variable lives in its environment or frame and
  f(X)'s argument names it, so `T = f(X), setarg(1, T, z)` leaves X unbound
  where SWI (which made X in the argument) binds it.
* **A core builtin raises SWI's error, catchably** (1.10.6): `=..`,
  `functor/3`, `arg/3` and `is/2` name what is wrong as SWI does
  (`type_error(evaluable, foo/2)`, `domain_error(non_empty_list, [])`; an
  integer-only function -- `//`, div, mod, rem, gcd, `>>`, `<<`, the
  bitwise four, msb -- names the float it was given, the left one first,
  `type_error(integer, 1.5)`, and msb/1 of an integer under 1 is
  `domain_error(not_less_than_one, N)`: through 1.14.0 each named heap
  cell 0, under -s the loaded file's path; `coco_not_integer`, 1.15.0), and
  assert and retract refuse an unbound clause, a head that is not callable,
  a body with a number or a string where a goal stands, and a clause for a
  control construct (`permission_error(modify, static_procedure, ','/2)`).
  A fact under a core builtin's name is KEPT, where SWI refuses it:
  library(reasoning) stores word classes such as `number(dos)` and reads
  them with `clause/2` (refusing it stopped `test/translate.pl`).
  `coco_fail_err`, which ends the query
  where no `catch/3` sees it, is left for a machine past saving (a growth
  refused outright, an inference limit) and a load that cannot go on --
  memory refused and then given less is resource_error(memory) since
  1.10.28; a new builtin raises through `coco_raise`. `format/2`'s
  `~a`, `~s` and the format itself take text of any length
  (`coco_text_put`).
* **The backtrace is written by the throw, before anything unwinds**
  (1.10.17, `coco_bt_capture` beside `coco_throw`), and only for a ball no
  catch on the chain of engines would take as things stand
  (`coco_bt_caught`: it can say "nobody" of a catch that takes the ball
  once the bindings are undone, never the reverse). What keeps it true:
  **the goal in flight is `kcall`** -- set by `coco_builtin_call` and
  `coco_builtin` (one store a builtin call: the only instruction a run
  that throws nothing pays, `tools/flow/zero.sh`), by the module seam as before,
  and at each raise of the step and the constructs (an unbound or
  non-callable goal, an unknown procedure, `throw/1`, `call/N`); **a new
  raise site outside a builtin sets `kcall` first**. **A builtin that
  starts an engine and throws its ball again sets `m->btkeep`** before
  `coco_throw` (findall, `call_metered/4`, `with_output_to/2`), so the
  inner throw's lines -- which already read out through every engine --
  are kept. **An engine whose starter reports its own errors sets
  `btstop`** (a directive's, `lb_goal_hook`), and the starter keeps the
  lines only when its goal raised; a load drops any it finds first
  (`coco_bt_say(m, 0)`). Trace 3 (`--backtrace`) is trace 1 that prints
  nothing: `coco_trace_port`, the Redo and the Fail return at once.
* **A cyclic term (`X = f(X)`) is written, raised, caught and walked**
  (1.10.18, 1.10.19; `test/cyclic.pl`), to swipl 9.0.4's answers. The
  writer asks `coco_acyclic` of the compound it meets 1024 levels down
  (`m->wdeep`; a cycle sets `wcyc` and `wdeep` 0, which stops every compound
  still to be written) and runs Brent's method down a list's tail; the top
  of the write takes back what it wrote and writes `@(S_1,[S_1=f(S_1)])`
  from `coco_factorize`, swipl's text to the letter -- `S_N` unless the
  write names variables itself (write_term's `variable_names`) or is
  write_canonical's or the store's. `is/2` and the comparisons ask at 1024
  levels and raise `type_error(expression, E)`, E their whole argument.
  `acyclic_term/1` and `cyclic_term/1` answer. **Every other walk COUNTS,
  and asks or changes course only past its count** -- what it has met
  against what a tree on this heap could hold -- so a term that is no cycle
  pays a decrement:
  - unify counts pairs of compounds down `m->ubudget` (2^20, or the heap's
    length if more, armed again only when it reaches 0, so it runs on ACROSS
    calls), and at 0 the rest of that walk links each pair it enters
    (`coco_unify_linked`: A's header points at B until the walk ends, as
    SWI's do_unify does) -- sound wherever it starts, a link never changing
    a unify's answer. The store's matcher counts the heap's length and hands
    a pair past it to `coco_unify`.
  - compare, `==` and the sorts count `m->cbudget` down from the heap's
    length, per call, the first pair in `ca`/`cb`, and at 0 the walk's EXIT
    asks again from that pair with links (`coco_compare_linked`). SWI links
    from the first pair, so two cyclic terms that differ within the count are
    ordered as their trees are where SWI's links may give no order (the
    case's P and Q: SWI answers > both ways).
  - copy_term/2 stops at `m->wceil` (three times the heap it started from,
    plus 64) and copies again keeping each compound once
    (`coco_copy_shared`): a cycle stays a cycle, a DAG a DAG.
  - the store's put (findall's results, `nb_setval/2`, a ball, a clause)
    stops at `base + 2 * heap_len + 64`, and `coco_store_put_over` asks
    `coco_acyclic`: a DAG is put whole, a cycle as its factors
    `'$cyclic'(T, [V=B, ...])`, counted in `m->cyc_puts`. **A reader of a
    cell that may hold one reads it with `coco_store_read`** (findall,
    `nb_getval/2`, every ball), which binds the factors back once `cyc_puts`
    has moved; `coco_store_get` hands it the factors.
  - assert raises `representation_error(cyclic_term)` when its put counted
    one (the store's length set back); a grammar rule is asked BEFORE its
    translation, which recursed through a cyclic body to a SIGSEGV; the
    clause check counts 4096 goals before it asks.
  - ground/1 and term_variables/2 count the heap's length, then walk again
    meeting each compound once, in SWI's order; unify_with_occurs_check/2
    unifies, then asks `coco_occurs` of each variable it bound, unbound for
    the question.
  - a list that is its own tail: `coco_m_list_length` (and so a module's
    lists), is_list/1, memberchk/2 and the text walks (a code or char list,
    a format's text and `~s`, term_to_atom/2's) count the heap's length --
    the last two down `m->lbudget`, which no two of them hold at once.
    length/2, msort/2, memberchk/2 and the text builtins raise
    `type_error(list, L)` (`coco_list_cyclic`, Brent), a format and
    term_to_atom/2 `type_error(text, L)`; sort/2 and a sort/4 that drops
    duplicates take it as the set of its elements; proper_length/2 and
    is_set/1 ask is_list/1 first.
  **A walk's slow path is NOT STATIC, and its count lives in the machine
  where a local would cost its loop a register** (`coco_compare_linked`,
  `coco_store_put_over`; `cbudget`, `ubudget`, `lbudget`): inlined, the
  linked compare cost every pair 18 instructions; with a local count
  memberchk/2 kept the machine on the stack, +12 % of its cost. Not SWI's
  yet: list_to_set/2 and the library's other clauses walk a cyclic list for
  ever where SWI's must_be/2 raises (append/3 and maplist/N loop in both);
  call/1 of `G = (true, G)` runs for ever where SWI refuses to compile it; a
  channel and thread_create/2's goal carry one as the text of its factors,
  which reads back as `@(T, [V=B, ...])`; a format's `~s` and `~a` raise
  cocolog's error for anything not text where SWI says
  `format_argument_type`; the text builtins that write any term
  (string_length/2, split_string/4, ...) write a cyclic list as its factors
  where SWI raises; term_to_atom/2 names the factors `S_1` where swipl
  writes a variable (`_3586`), and 1.10.18's case pins `S_1` as SWI's;
  numbervars/3 does not exist. subsumes_term/2, `=@=/2` and `\=@=/2`
  (2.1.0) do, built on the walks above: Specific's variables collected,
  a unify, each variable asked still unbound and none made one (the
  variable map), the unify undone; `=@=/2` asks a COPY of its first term
  both ways, so a variable the two share is not bound across, and sets
  the heap back after; `0.0 =@= -0.0` fails, as unify's floats are SWI's
  since 2.1.1 (below). term_variables/2's collector looks a
  variable up in the map past sixteen (2.1.0; it scanned, and 200 000
  variables took 6.8 s). A
  deep TREE overflows the C stack where it always did (~47k levels of
  `coco_write_rec`, ~87k of `coco_arith`). **The writer's six arguments
  stay in registers**: quoted, ignore_ops and operand are one `mode` word
  (1, 2, 4), and a compound is `coco_write_fun`, always inlined, so the
  guard's slow path returns rather than rejoining -- rejoined, every
  compound read its tag and functor again (21 instructions each).
* **A directive is a GOAL.** `coco_directive` answers the ones that act on the
  reader (`op/3`, `set_prolog_flag/2`, `dynamic/1`, `discontiguous/1`,
  `multifile/1`, `module/2`, `use_module/1,2`, `autoload/1,2`,
  `ensure_loaded/1`, `meta_predicate/1`, `if/elif/else/endif`) and calls
  everything else in file order. `initialization(G)` runs after the file is
  read, `initialization(G, now)` where it stands, `initialization(G, main)`
  after the load and then halts. A directive that fails or throws is
  reported in SWI's shapes and the load goes on; **a syntax error is the
  only thing that ends a consult.** A `use_module`/`ensure_loaded` that
  loads nothing is reported the same way (since 1.8.39: SWI's ERROR
  `source_sink ... does not exist`, then the failed directive; it used to
  be SILENT), except SWI's names for what cocolog carries elsewhere --
  `error`, `dcg/basics`, `dcg/high_order`, `lb_carried` in
  `lib/library.cicili`. A module is claimed BEFORE its consult,
  so a goal directive in a module (and every `-s` program is one) no longer
  re-consults it.
* **Consulting a file REPLACES the clauses it put in the store last time**
  (per-clause `origins`; `'$from'(Path, Clause)` on the wire); asserted
  clauses and other files' are untouched.
* **An uncaught exception reads as SWI's sentence** (`coco_error_text`):
  `Unknown procedure: main/0`, `Unknown message: Ball`.
* **There is a string type** (cell tag `STR`); `double_quotes` takes `codes`
  (default), `chars`, `atom`, `string`, for the REST of the file, per
  machine, forced back to `codes` across a module load. **A string does not
  survive the store or a channel** -- it comes back as codes (canonical text
  is read with the flag honoured; splitting the readers is the unfinished
  fix).
* **A `throw/1` inside `findall/3`, `forall/2` or `aggregate_all/3` reaches
  the catch around it**, and a `catch/3` whose goal exited stops catching
  (`'$catch_exit'`) -- and, with nothing above it left to retry, takes its
  frame with it (1.13.4, SWI's I_EXITCATCH; through 1.13.3 a recursion that
  caught around a deterministic call kept a choice point a turn). The
  marker's arm is the (weak) `coco_catch_exit`: a store written into the
  inlined construct code moved the step loop's registers.
* **Text builtins work on CHARACTERS, SWI's, and on BYTES when a program
  asks** (`text_units`: 1.13.0, and characters the default since 2.0.0;
  bytes were through 1.x). A code is a code point, a char one character of
  however many bytes, in the text builtins, the reader (`"..."`, `0'c`),
  format's `~c`, `~s` and codes/chars sinks, char_type/2 (past ASCII as
  glibc's C.UTF-8 classes them, swipl on Linux: `coco_uc_case`,
  `coco_uc_letter`, `coco_uc_space` in lib/term.cicili, written out),
  read/write_file_from_codes, library(stream)'s text streams,
  library(process)'s output, library(text) and the document libraries'
  character references. A byte that is no UTF-8 decodes to U+DC00 plus the
  byte and encodes back to it (`coco_utf8_get`/`_enc`), so a binary file
  read as codes goes back byte for byte. `:- set_prolog_flag(text_units,
  bytes).` -- or `COCOLOG_TEXT_UNITS=bytes` for a run -- gives 1.x's
  answers, per machine (`m->text_chars`, kept in a frozen machine's `U`
  section, and a blob with no `U` thaws in bytes; the directive also sets
  the process default, `coco_text_default`, so a thread or
  `run_isolated/2` made after it counts the same): `atom_length('dár', N)`
  is 4, `atom_codes/2` gives the UTF-8 bytes, `char_code(X, 225)` one raw
  byte, `sub_atom/5` can cut a character in half, `upcase_atom('dár', U)`
  is `DáR`, `atom_chars('dár', L)` is four one-byte atoms that join back to
  `'dár'`, and `atom_chars(X, [d,'á',r])` raises `type_error(character,
  'á')` (through 1.11.7 a SEGMENTATION FAULT). **`string_bytes(Text, Bytes,
  utf8)` (2.0.0, SWI's) is the crossing that does not move with the
  units**: a text's UTF-8 bytes, or the string of some bytes -- what
  `atom_codes/2` is under bytes. **A socket is bytes**: `library(tcp)` and
  `library(tls)` read and write 0..255 whatever the program counts, and
  `library(http)`, `library(httpd)`, `library(websocket)` (a text message;
  a binary one is bytes) and `library(curl)` cross at the wire with
  string_bytes/3, handing the program text in its units (2.0.0: through
  1.15 they handed bytes, and under characters a path `caf%C3%A9` was
  `cafÃ©`, a websocket refused to send `héllo`, a body went out a byte a
  code point with a Content-Length of characters, and curl's bytes past 127
  came back negative in either unit). A NEW LIBRARY THAT MAKES AN ATOM FROM
  WIRE BYTES, OR WIRE BYTES FROM THE PROGRAM'S TEXT, GOES THROUGH
  string_bytes/3, never atom_codes/2. A binary stream is bytes, the writer
  still quotes `'dár'` (the reader takes no unquoted letter past ASCII),
  library(text)'s regexes match bytes, and library(flow)'s widths and
  columns ask the flag past 127 (a code of 128..191 is a continuation byte
  only under bytes). test/units.pl holds it to swipl. Under bytes, build
  and take apart accented text with atom_concat/3 (modes -,+,+ and +,-,+),
  atomic_list_concat/2 and member/2 over a list of the suffixes, as
  tr_stress_stem/2 does. **A syntax error in a load is
  placed** (1.11.9): `ERROR: FILE:LINE:COL: Syntax error: REASON`, the column
  from 0 in bytes as swipl's, from `run` and `-s` alike -- a module's names
  ITS file, through `use_module` and through the load a goal's ask makes
  (`load_err` on the store) -- and the consult still ends there. Through
  1.11.8 `run` said a byte offset and `-s` only `its clauses would not
  consult`.
* **`atomic_list_concat/3` with a bound third argument and a non-ground list
  SPLITS**; `/2` cannot split; `atom_concat/3` has `(+,-,+)` and `(-,+,+)` but
  no `(-,-,+)`; `string_concat/3` only `(+,+,-)`. **`sub_atom/5` and
  `sub_string/5` are clauses** walking every position -- use
  `atom_concat/3`, `memberchk/2`, `split_string/4` in a hot path.
* **A call is keyed on whichever bound argument chooses** (since 1.9.1):
  the first argument's table as always, and for a predicate the first
  argument will not do for (`coco_pred_first_enough`: at or over the floor
  of 8 clauses, with the call's first argument unbound, or the longest
  key's chain and the variable heads together over 4) a table per
  argument 2 to 8 (`coco_argix`), built the first time a call wants one,
  kept by `assertz`, dropped by `asserta`, `retract` and a reconsult. The
  argument with the fewest candidates wins (`coco_pred_select`), once per
  call, and the choice rides in the choice frame (`ixpos`, never frozen: a
  thawed frame is keyed on the first argument, which is always sound); a
  retry starts from the chain link of the clause just tried, so
  backtracking through one key's clauses is linear. **A call with no bound
  argument still walks the whole predicate**; a hit hides it, a miss or a
  `findall` pays it. To read a predicate's heads, `clause/2` enumerates
  them; calling the goal proves it.
* **A global is found by a hash of its name (1.9.4), copied AS ITS BLOCK,
  and a GROUND one's copy handed out shared while it lives (1.12.1)**
  (`nb_getval/2`, `b_getval/2`, `nb_current/2`; `coco_b_global_term`).
  The store put a value's cells together from its root, every reference
  among them, so a read is a memcpy and each REF moved by the distance
  (`coco_store_read_block`): 3 000 entries 26 us, 98 through 1.12.0's walk
  a cell at a time, and the translator's reads went from 12 % of its
  instructions to 4 % (-7.9 % in all, its case -3.2 % of user time). A
  ground copy is then kept by the machine (`gcache`, by the global's index
  and version `gver`, for the store whose serial it names, a root of the
  collector) and a repeated read is 0.2 us at any size -- as SWI's:
  setarg/3 and nb_setarg/3 on it change the global (SWI's counter idiom
  works) until nb_setval/2 sets it again; a value with a variable is a
  fresh copy each read, where SWI shares it. **The copy is kept FOR AS
  LONG AS IT LIVES**: its sentinel on the trail is undone when
  backtracking or the end of a nested search goes back past it and takes
  its cells, and a read that does not find it where it was put copies
  again (`coco_gcache_ok`; the collector moves it with the trail and tells
  the copy); the hosts' registered positions are raised over it at the
  fill; nb_setarg/3
  into it pins it (`coco_gcache_pin`: every mark raised, as SWI's
  freezeGlobal()). So **a new wind-back of the heap across Prolog
  execution undoes the trail to its mark or registers its position**, or
  a stale copy is read. Raising every mark at each fill instead kept what
  backtracking had always given back: the translator's case 12 % slower,
  16 collections become 34. Only 5 % of the translator's reads find their
  copy alive -- it backtracks past nearly every one -- so its gain is the
  block. A memberchk/2 of 300 entries already on the heap is 4.7 us: the
  translator's table of a common word (`è`, `di`) holds 300 entries.
* **The six term walks borrow the machine's stacks** (copy, store-put,
  store-get, store-unify, unify, compare: `coco_wframes_take`/`_give`,
  `coco_wpairs_take`/`_give` in `lib/term.cicili`), and the three that
  rename variables borrow its variable map too (`coco_varmap_take`/`_give`:
  an open-addressed table, epoch-stamped so nothing is cleared between
  copies; its hash must spread CONSECUTIVE keys -- a multiply alone put a
  whole clause's variables in one slot). They are iterative so a
  200 000-element list cannot overflow the C stack, and when each walk
  allocated its stack per call, queens took 61% longer (1.8.38's bisection,
  STATUS.md). A walk must not `malloc` per call; anything new on that path
  is measured with `sh bench/langs.sh` or a same-sitting pair.
* **`coco_make` dereferences every argument it stores**, which is what keeps
  the continuation from becoming a REF chain and the engine from going
  quadratic; `test/engine.pl` guards it with a hundred-fold-margin timeout.
* **The store compacts itself** at safe points (four million dead cells
  outnumbering the live, or doubling growth); `garbage_collect/0` forces
  one; a caller holding cell indices registers them
  (`coco_store_root_push`).
* **The heap is collected since 1.8.36** (`coco_heap_gc`, a sliding
  mark-compact that keeps cell order, so heap marks stay true): at a step
  boundary, under a host that set `e->gc` -- `-s`, `run`, `query`, the
  REPL, `step`, `run_isolated/2`. A host holding cell indices across a
  step registers them with `coco_heap_root_push` (the REPL's variable
  table) or leaves `gc` off. **Since 1.9.4 the engines a builtin starts
  collect too** -- `findall/3` and so `forall/2` and `aggregate_all/3`,
  `call_metered/4`, `with_output_to/2`: the starter registers what its own
  frame holds (the caller's goal cell comes in as `gp`), the engines part
  way through a step are on the machine's chain (`m->eng`, `e->outer`),
  and the marks the starter winds the machine back to (`ptrail`, `pheap`)
  are a barrier the trail is compacted against and are moved with the
  cells. A starter that does none of this leaves its engine's `gc` off;
  trace no longer does (1.9.6: the tracer's roots -- `trace_goal`,
  `tchoices`, the `'$trace_exit'` indices -- are moved for every engine on
  the chain). **A goal a load runs collects only when its caller vouched**
  (`dgc` on the machine, 1.9.6), set around ONE call by `cocolog
  run`/`consult`, by the run's top around the modules' load, and by
  `use_module/1,2` as a goal (`lb_use`, which is how `-s` loads its file);
  each frame on the way reads it, clears it, and sets it back only around
  a call whose cells it registered (`coco_heap_root_push`, and
  `coco_heap_pos_push` for a position such as a load's `mark`/`back`). A
  directive's `use_module` runs no goal and is not vouched; a new caller
  of a load vouches nothing until it registers what it reads after. A
  search a builtin starts, and a vouched goal of a load, collects only
  once it has grown by the floor itself (`coco_gc_nested_begin`).
  1.9.3 needed 1.25 GB for three million turns of a loop inside
  `findall/3` that now runs in 44 MB, and the linter peaks at 53 MB
  against 73, for 0.86 % more instructions (four collections). A
  collection is due when `heap_len` reaches `gc_next`;
  `garbage_collect/0` asks for one by setting `gc_next` to 0, and the end
  of a search keeps a 0 nothing inside it could serve.
  `COCOLOG_GC_CELLS=N` sets the floor (2000 tortures it, and children
  inherit it), `COCOLOG_KMAT=1|2` puts every collection through a freeze's
  materialisation first, `statistics(heap_collections, N)` counts them,
  and a `_G` name is a heap position, so it changes across a collection.
  **The float and string tables are reclaimed in place since 1.9.6**
  (`coco_tables_reclaim`, after the slide; NOT STATIC: inlined into the
  collector it cost nrev 0.12 %): an entry no heap cell, no store of an
  engine on the chain and no compiled program names is dead, a string's
  bytes are freed, the dead tail is cut off and the rest become free lists
  taken lowest index first. A live entry never moves, so no cell is
  rewritten. It waits for `tlimit` entries made (65 536 at first) AND half
  the heap's length, and `coco_table_made` asks for a collection on that
  rule; a new holder of float or string cells outside those three is a
  root it must be taught. The atom table is never reclaimed.
* **The atom, functor and predicate tables are hashed** (open addressing, an
  entry its id plus one, kept under half full -- checked BEFORE the probe, so
  a failed rehash still leaves an empty slot). Ids stay in order of first
  use, which a frozen machine relies on; `coco_name_arity_hash` serves the
  functors (`lib/term.cicili`) and the predicates (`lib/kb.cicili`). Each
  table has exactly one writer (`coco_functor_id`, `coco_pred_make`); keep
  it that way. The functor also remembers which module owns a goal of its
  name (`dmod`/`dgen`, since 1.8.42): the `strcmp` walk over the modules
  runs once per functor per registry generation, and `coco_module_register`
  raises `coco_extern_generation` so a name nobody owned is asked again.
  **That is true only of a dispatcher whose claim is the name and arity**: a
  hand-written one that turns a goal down by its arguments or its state
  (torch: `tensor_execution/3`, every `tensor_*` under another backend)
  calls `coco_m_decline` first, a walk with a decline in it keeps nothing
  on the functor, and an owner that declines sends the call through the
  whole walk (1.8.45; MODULES.md). A module that declines without saying so
  leaves the functor with the knowledge base after a first declined call.
  **Since 1.8.55 the functor is also stamped as a plain predicate**
  (`fgen`): set only on the step's slow path, when no construct, no builtin
  and no module claims the name (a construct's name never: it can turn a
  goal down by its shape), and honoured while it carries the registry's
  generation and the store's `pst`/`pserial`, not under trace. A stamped
  goal skips every question and goes to `pidx`. **A new way for something to
  claim a name must make the stamp stale**, as `coco_module_register` does
  by raising the generation; `test/module.cicili` registers a module after
  its name was a plain predicate and goes red if the stamp outlives it.
* **The first goal of an entered clause travels in the engine, not in a
  frame** (`ngoal`/`nbar`/`nset`, since 1.8.55): `coco_try_clause` hands it
  over and the next step takes it, and only the body's other goals are
  `'$k'` frames. Before anything reads the continuation as a term -- a
  collection, a stop at the inference limit, a halt -- the loop pushes it
  back as a frame (`coco_k_flush`). **A new return from the loop, or a
  builtin that inspects `e->goals`, flushes first**; every caller of
  `coco_try_clause` today is a step about to end. **A builder of the
  continuation that finds no room writes nothing**, answers 0 and sets
  `halted` to 2 (`coco_k_room`: `coco_k_push`, `coco_k_push_roots`,
  `coco_areg_term`), which stops the run at the next step's top and
  `coco_engine_next` answers as `out of memory` (1.9.4); a new builder
  does the same. (A growth given less than it asked stops it with the same
  2 and no `oom`, and that one is raised: resource_error(memory), 1.10.28,
  below.) `test/state.cicili` stops
  a proof at each of its first sixty steps and resumes it in another
  machine, `test/gc.pl` collects every 2000 cells under naive reverse, and
  each goes red without its flush. **Since 1.9.1 that goal may never be
  built at all**: a first goal (after the guards) that calls a plain
  predicate writes its arguments into the engine's registers (`areg`, two
  banks of eight, `nset` 2, the code's register form `rbody`), and the
  next step tries the callee's one candidate straight from them
  (`coco_try_clause` given the bank); a choice to keep, no clauses, a call
  another argument would key better, or a flush builds the term first
  (`coco_areg_term`). The stamp is asked when the registers are written
  (`coco_regs_ok`) and not again: nothing that could change its answer
  runs in between. A callee with two clauses or more whose first argument
  is a variable keeps the term form (`cc_regs_worth`), its every call
  leaving a choice.
* **A body's leading arithmetic and type tests run as its clause is
  entered** (`gbody`, the guards, since 1.9.1): `X is E` over integers, the
  six comparisons, and `var`/`nonvar`/`atom`/`integer`/`number`/`atomic`/
  `compound` of a variable met before, up to eight, compiled into a program
  over a stack of integers (`cc_compile_guards`, `cc_guards_run`) and run
  between the head and the body (`coco_clause_run_g`). **A guard only ever
  takes the road the step would have**: whatever it cannot decide -- a
  variable not bound to an integer, a float, a zero divisor, an operator
  not in `*cc-gops*` -- stops the guards before that goal has done
  anything, and the body is built from that goal (`gstart`). Each guard
  that runs is an inference, the one that fails too, and under an
  inference limit only as many run as the limit has room for
  (`coco_guard_budget`), so `statistics(inferences)` and every stop are
  what they were; under trace none runs. The arithmetic is `coco_arith`'s
  own C, and a result is compared or bound as the cell `coco_new_int`
  makes. `test/engine.pl` holds every operator and test to the step's
  answer, errors included; a recursion that must make garbage for the
  collector now has to build something (`test/gc.pl`).
* **A clause is COMPILED the first time it is selected** (`coco_clause_code`
  and `coco_clause_run` in `lib/kb.cicili`, since 1.8.44; `coco_clause_run_r`
  for a call or a goal in registers and `coco_clause_run_g` for a body with
  guards, each its own function so that a clause using none of it runs
  exactly the first, and the head and body programs written once as the
  macros `cc-head-program` and `cc-body-program`): a head program --
  the WAM's GET and UNIFY instructions over a frame of the clause's
  variables, a nested structure flattened through a temporary, READ or
  WRITE mode per structure -- and a body program that builds the goals top
  down through the frame and lists their roots, which go on the
  continuation as `'$k'` frames exactly as a copied body did -- N frames
  reserved in one growth check (`coco_k_push_roots`, 1.8.46). The frame
  lives for the one call (an array, not a heap object: 128 slots on the C
  stack, past that the machine's kept `cslots`), so nothing new is
  frozen and a clause asserted while its body runs cannot move the body
  under it. The code is keyed by the clause's cell in a table on the
  store, cleared when the store compacts and dropped clause by clause
  where one dies (`coco_code_drop`: retract, reconsult -- without it a
  retract-and-assert counter held a program per dead clause, 298 MB at a
  million rounds); a constant is its cell and a functor its id, so a
  compaction cannot stale it. **The predicate keeps a copy of each
  clause's program pointer** (`coco_pred.codes`, since 1.8.46), a fifth
  array parallel to `clauses`: every site that shifts, drops or renumbers
  the clause list moves it too -- asserta, retract, `coco_pred_forget_from`,
  the compaction's second pass (which nils it: the table is about to be
  cleared) -- and a sixth array would go to the same five places. **The
  body program is a layout** (1.8.46): a goal's root word carries the
  cells the goal takes, each ARG word the offset of its slot (K) and of
  the cell it fills (N), the executor reserves the goal once and keeps no
  stack; a program ends at its length (no END word). **Each number in an
  instruction has its own field** -- a frame index or a slot offset in 24
  bits, an argument index, an arity or a cell offset in 32;
  GET_STRUCT once packed two into 16 bits each and a head structure of
  65 536 arguments read back wrong (1.8.45) -- and a clause past what a
  field holds is not compiled. A clause the compiler
  cannot take (a head that is not callable, a frame over 2^24 - 1 slots) or
  whose program cannot RUN (`coco_clause_run` answers -1: no memory) is
  matched in the store and copied as before (`coco_store_unify`,
  `coco_store_get_vm`: the store is
  never bound, a variable met first lives in the slot `coco_push_struct`
  reserved). The engine's own names and functors -- `'$k'`, `$true`,
  `$fail`, `$cut`, `:-`, the markers -- are interned once per machine
  beside the ids (`fids`, `coco-fid`); add to `*functor-names*`, never
  call `coco_make` with a literal name on a hot path. **A list cell is
  built with `coco_cons` and recognised with `coco_is_cons`** (1.9.2), by
  `'.'/2`'s functor id kept on the machine (`cons1`, learnt on first use
  so the intern order stays first-use) -- never by `strcmp` with `"."`:
  `=..` once tested the name alone, and a `'.'/1` in its list ran away to
  13 GB. A `'$k'` frame is
  four cells with the barrier an INT in its slot. **A deterministic call
  gets no choice frame** (1.8.46): the engine asks `coco_pred_probe` for
  the first candidate and whether a second exists, and with none tries the
  clause over the machine's own marks with `nchoices` as the barrier --
  what the frame's index would have been; under trace a frame is pushed
  as before, the Fail port is printed from it. **The evaluator dispatches
  by id** (`*arith-names*`, interned beside the dispatch names; a symbol
  in that list is a COCO_OP_* array, for the three names a Cicili string
  cannot end): add an evaluable functor to the table, never a `strcmp`;
  two integer leaves under `+`, `-`, `*` are combined in `coco_arith`
  without the recursive asks. **A raise inside the loop is never
  `return`ed**: `coco_raise` answers 2 when a catcher took the ball and
  the continuation is the recovery goal, so the loop goes round
  (`continue`); three sites returned the 2 through 1.8.45 and
  `catch(call(_), E, true)` ended the query with exit status 2 and no
  message (`test/errors.pl`, "an unbound or non-callable goal is
  catchable"). The proposal's lazy body was counted and not built
  (1.9.1): the translator's clause bodies average 1.9 goals and a third
  of its inferences are control constructs (`;`, `->`, `catch/3`), which
  no lazy body touches -- the constructs are what environments took on.
* **A body with a construct writes ONE environment when it is entered**
  (Stages 5 and 6, 1.9.3): an if-then-else, `\+`/`not`, `once/1`,
  `ignore/1`, a `;`, or a `,` inside one, after the body's guards and its
  first goal. It is a compound on the heap, `'$e'(Code, Parent, Barrier,
  V1 ... Vn, T1 ... Tm, S1 ... Sj, P1 ... Pk)` (`cc-env-entry`): the code
  as an integer, the continuation the body returns to, its cut barrier, a
  slot per variable a later call reads, one per later goal built at entry
  as a term (a builtin, anything not a plain predicate), a condition slot
  per if-then-else (the choice height its step writes), and a POS cell
  (tag 6) per UNIT -- what one `'$k'` frame held through 1.9.2: a goal, a
  construct, a condition, a branch, a `,`'s item, a construct's own
  `$cut`, `$true`, `$fail` (`coco_egoal`). **The continuation is still
  one cell**: a frame, the empty atom, or a POS cell naming a unit (the
  distance back to the header over bit 16, the unit under it). The loop
  tells them by tag; `coco_env_take` hands a unit's goal over and the
  same step dispatches it, or does the construct's step itself (pushing
  the else's choice, cutting to a condition's height). **Each unit taken
  is the step its frame was**, so inference counts and every stop are
  1.9.2's. The arm is `COCOLOG_ENV=0`; the engine's cases run programs
  both ways to one answer. What bites:
  - **A body without a construct makes none**: its later calls cost from
    an environment what their frames did (environments for every body:
    the linter 0.23 % further on, queens 0.96 % back). `*->` and a
    construct reached through `call/1` stay terms.
  - **A core builtin among the later goals is done where it stands**
    (Stage 7, 1.9.5; `cc_uplace` picks the kind): `is/2`, the comparisons
    and the type tests as a GUARD, Stage 4's program over the slots
    (`coco_env_guard`; no AG_ISF there -- a variable it meets first was
    made with the environment), whose term is built and handed over only
    when the program cannot decide; `=/2`, `==/2`, `\==/2` as SIDES, read
    out of the slots like a call's registers (`coco_env_sides`); any other
    with arguments as a BUILTIN, its entry-built term called by its row
    (`coco_builtin_call`), its first-met variables made in cell order
    (`cc_uslots` BYCELL, at most 64, past that a TERM). Each is still one
    step and one inference. The three run in `coco_env_place`, which is
    OUT OF LINE AND NOT STATIC: inlined into the take they cost the step
    loop its registers (lookup +0.68 % with the arm off). The arm is
    `COCOLOG_INPLACE=0`; the take answers -3 for a builtin's error nothing
    caught, and the loop ends the run as the step's call did.
  - **An `is/2` over `+`, `-`, `*`, or one of the six comparisons, whose
    operands are each a slot or an integer constant, is ONE fused word**
    (1.9.6, AG_ISX/AG_CMPX, unit kind GUARDX): `cc_ufuse`, a peephole in
    `cc_uguard`, makes it, `cc_uleaf` sets the kind, `coco_env_guardx`
    does it through `coco_env_place` (the take's default), and
    `coco_unit_term` builds it back. It decides only when both operands
    are integers; otherwise the term is handed over as a GUARD's is. Still
    one step and one inference. The arm is `COCOLOG_FUSE=0`.
  - **A unit kind lives in seven places**: `*cc-eg-kinds*`, the compiler
    (`cc_unit`, `cc_ubranch`, `cc_ulink`, `cc_uplace`), the offsets the
    take reads (`noff` ... `rvars`, set at the end of `cc_compile_env`),
    the take's switch, `coco_env_place` for the builtins in place, and
    `coco_unit_term`, which builds a unit back as the term its
    frame held -- for a freeze (`coco_engine_materialize` builds every
    position's goals, raises the choice frames' heap marks, and puts it
    all back after: a frozen machine carries no environment) and for the
    tracer (under trace no environment is made, and a unit taken under
    trace is handed over as its term, port for port). **`COCOLOG_KMAT`
    tortures the freeze** (1.9.4): every collection materialises first,
    1 putting it back as a freeze does, 2 keeping it so the run goes on as
    a thawed machine would; with `COCOLOG_GC_CELLS=2000` that is every
    2000 cells, and children inherit both. `test/gc.pl` runs `rt/2`,
    `rb/2` and the environment fixture under it; only 2 sees a wrong unit
    term (and `test/trace.pl`'s `env_late`, from inside a traced body).
  - **The collector keeps an environment whole from any position** (the
    POS rule in `coco_gc_mark`) and every retired code a live environment
    names (`coco_gc_codes`). A clause that dies while an environment is
    part way through its body goes on running that code -- the logical
    update view -- so the code is retired, not freed (`coco_code_retire`),
    and a compaction keys kept codes again.
  - **What the take reads is settled at compile time** -- each offset the
    header plus one number, the kind a switch, a call's variable arguments
    copied slot to register in the take -- and a goal it hands over is
    dispatched in the same step: recomputed per take, every argument a
    dispatched word in `coco_env_regs` and each handed-over goal a second
    trip round the loop, lookup's loop was 3.9 % dearer than its frames;
    settled, 6.5 % cheaper.
  - **`ex` is what entering a clause takes**: 0 plain, 1 guards, 2 an
    environment, 3 both, so `coco_try_clause` asks a plain clause one
    question. Guards and an environment have their own executor
    (`coco_clause_run_ge`) and their own copy of the guards' runner
    (`cc-guards-body`); guards that stop short build the body from the one
    they stopped at and make no environment, as 1.9.2 built it.
* **Two clocks: the steps, and the inferences, which are the steps less the
  `true`s and `=/2`s** (1.12.2; SWI counts neither in a compiled body).
  `e->steps` counts every goal at the loop's top, as always: the tracer, a
  window, the recorder and library(flow/debug) number calls by it, and no
  two calls share a number (one clock with those steps given back made a
  free goal share the next call's number, and dbgmatch keys a call by its
  number: its first build lost calls). `e->frees` counts the free ones where
  they run -- `coco_construct`'s `true`, `coco_bi_unify`, an environment's
  TRUE unit when its functor is `true` (a construct's `$true` stays a step)
  and a SIDES unit of form 0 -- and a new place that runs either counts it
  there too. `coco_bi_unify` is `(static) (inline)` (1.13.5): with the count
  in it clang stopped inlining it into the builtin switch, about 5
  instructions a `=/2` more. A slowdown the instructions do not explain may
  be where the code sits: 1.13.0 moved `coco_clause_run` 32 bytes into a
  64-byte line and cicili-lang's `=/2` loop ran 8 % slower on the same
  instructions (STATUS.md, 1.13.5). What a program reads is `steps - frees`: statistics/2's
  `inferences`, call_metered/4's Used, call_limited/3's and call_metered/4's
  limits, `cocolog step`'s budget and its `suspended at`. **A limit in
  inferences is `max_inf`, and the hot loop tests `max_steps` alone**: a
  limit sets `max_steps` to the inference limit itself (no more steps can be
  inferences), and past it the cold path makes ONE call out of line,
  `coco_limit_go`, which asks `coco_limit_room` (moving `max_steps` on to
  the limit plus the frees so far, never past `tcap`, a limit in steps from
  an engine outside: a window's), then `coco_step_free` (the tracer's Exit
  marker, which gives its step back and is taken before a stop), then
  `coco_rec_open`; nothing goes on, and the run stops. Three calls in the
  loop moved its registers: lookup ran eight more instructions a probe
  besides its padding (`tools/flow/zero.sh`; one call is 1.12.1's within
  0.05 %). A window's and the recorder's limits are in steps (`max_inf`
  0). **A nested engine
  narrows through `coco_limit_narrow`** (findall/3, call_metered/4 and
  call_limited/3, with_output_to/2): in inferences for an inference limit,
  in steps for a step limit, and its starter adds back its `frees` with its
  `steps`. A frozen machine keeps both (`I frees max_inf` in
  lib/state.cicili, after the operators, so an older blob reads as none),
  and `coco_engine_ask` starts both again (the REPL's engine, asked once a
  goal, read -2 for a goal after one with three free steps when only the
  steps started again).
  Free goals do not end a limited run early: a stop at one would be a stop
  at the step after, which is counted (a nested engine's last step at
  least), so the least limit that succeeds is still the count reported.
* **A window's clock moves MAX_STEPS to every step** (1.13.3,
  `'$trace_window'/4`'s `time(F, K)`, the probe of library(flow/debug)'s
  `time(T)`): under it an engine has `tclock` set, MAX_STEPS is the step at
  which the clock reads next and RMAX the limit it stands in for, which
  `coco_clock_go` asks at each reading as `coco_limit_go` asks a limit.
  **A new reader of `max_steps` as a limit reads `rmax` under `tclock`** --
  the guards' budget did not, and the clock timed an engine that ran no
  guard (it is asked inline: as a call out of line it cost naive reverse 2
  instructions an inference) -- and **a new nested engine narrows through
  `coco_limit_narrow`**, which hands it the clock, and **takes the clock
  back where its starter's own work begins** (`coco_clock_back`: findall/3
  at each answer and at its end, call_limited/3 and with_output_to/2 at
  theirs), or the starter's copying is charged to the inner goal read last.
  The clock's own work stays out of every inference's time: it reads again
  after its array grows, and a collection moves its reading on. **A retry
  is read apart** (1.13.7): each reading turns the clause frames pushed
  since the last into `COCO_CH_CLOCKED` (from `tlow`, lowered by any
  retry), and backtracking into one reads where the retry begins
  (`coco_clock_retry`; the next reading, or the end of a findall/3 search
  or of the run, closes it as `retry(I, Ns, Name/Arity)`). **The invariants
  it stands on**: every step's reading resets `tlow` to `nchoices`, no step
  shrinks the choice stack and then pushes, and nothing frozen ever holds
  a CLOCKED frame (a clock runs only in the engines a builtin starts). **A
  new frame kind in `coco_backtrack` gets its own equality test**: folded
  into an `or` with the kinds beside it, it cost the step loop its jump
  table (queens +0.08 %).
* **The whole run's clock charges a step to what its goal is NAMED by**
  (1.15.0, `run_time(R)`, library(flow/debug)'s `flow_run_time/3`): the
  same clock from the first step, but each reading charges its time to a
  KEY -- 1 + (a functor's id << 1), 1 + (an atom's id << 1 | 1), 0 for a
  step that names no goal (a solution handed back) -- read at the step's
  top by `coco_clock_key` from what the loop is about to take (the
  registers' `afid`, `ngoal`, a `'$k'` frame's goal, an environment unit's
  `fid` or its slot's term), never by changing anything. **So a new place
  the loop takes a goal from is a new arm of `coco_clock_key`**, or its
  steps are charged to whatever the old arms read there. A retry goes from
  the key of the step it ran in (`rpk`) to its predicate by its index in
  the store (`rpp`), named once as the run ends. **A nested engine is asked
  its goal BEFORE it is narrowed** (findall/3, call_limited/3,
  with_output_to/2): the clock names the new engine's first goal in the
  narrow, and an ask leaves the limits alone; the starter's step is kept on
  the starter (`e->tkey`) and given back in `coco_clock_back`. A guard a
  clause runs as it is entered is no step the clock reads: its time is its
  clause's predicate's, and is/2 run that way has no row.
* **The tracer keeps the untraced clock, and records as well as prints**
  (1.10.12). Taking the `'$trace_exit'` marker gives its step back
  (`coco_construct`), so a traced run counts what an untraced one does, and
  a turn stopped at its budget is saved with the steps it took
  (`cmd_step`; `call_metered/4` still answers L + 1 for a ceiling of L,
  which `test/engine.pl` pins). `trace` 2 is the record mode: every port
  goes to the machine's recorder (`m->rec`, a `coco_rec`), with the clause
  a call entered, the heads the selection TRIED that did not match
  (`coco_rec_heads`, read back from the frame after the selection: the
  index's candidates walked again with the key the selection read, which
  `coco_rec_hkey` keeps before the selection binds the call -- a head the
  index passed over is not recorded since 1.11.2, when one failed call of
  a 32,046-fact table recorded 32,046), an exception raised and where
  it was caught. `'$trace_window'/4` (lib/builtins.cicili) opens a window
  IN PLACE: the limit stops the fast-forward before inference F, narrowed
  into nested engines as any limit is, and the limit's branch
  (`coco_rec_open`) switches every engine on the chain to recording
  instead of stopping -- a stop inside `findall/3`'s engine and a resume
  would run the whole findall again. The collector is off in a window (a
  goal's cell names its call); an inference is the sum of the steps out
  along the chain (`coco_rec_abs`). **Every recorder function the loop or
  `coco_backtrack` calls is `(weak)`**, which Cicili emits as a function
  the compiler never inlines: inlined, the window's opening cost nrev
  0.45 % in the loop's registers. A window sees the calls made in it: one
  that began before has no Exit marker and no shadow frame. **The recorder
  records what the printer prints, port for port** (`test/window.pl` holds
  the two together over the trace case's queries): a retry's Redo, printed
  only once the retry enters a clause, is recorded PENDING as the retry
  begins (`coco_rec_unpend` takes it back when anything else is recorded
  first, the window's end included) -- through 1.10.12 a call that had
  exited and was backtracked past with no clause left showed a Redo the
  printer never printed. `library(flow/debug)` (lesson 51) stands on all of
  it: a probe and a replay in child processes (`cocolog run FILE GOAL`),
  the events matched to the chart's boxes (`library/flow/dbgmatch.pl`)
  and drawn (`library/flow/dbgdraw.pl`). **`throw/1` has no port**: the
  printer prints nothing for it and the recorder writes a throw event
  naming the BODY it was raised in -- for a builtin that raised, the body
  its call was made in -- so where a program threw is read from where that
  body was going next (the matcher's `thrown(Box, At)`, 1.11.7); the last
  call the body made had exited, and read as the raise, it put a throw
  written after an if-then-else in the then.
* **Under trace a cut keeps its own call's frame, SPENT** (1.10.24,
  `coco_trace_cut`): the Fail port is printed from the call's frame, and
  through 1.10.22 the cut took it, so a clause that cut and then failed
  printed no Fail (and a window's call never ended, `fate="open"`). A
  frame's kind is asked in five places -- `coco_backtrack`'s drop test,
  the `$trace_exit` marker's search, the `;` Redo's search,
  `coco_trace_reopen` and `$catch_exit`'s scan -- and a new kind goes to
  all five. **A frame is a call's by its depth (> 0), never by its goal**:
  a goal can be heap cell 0, and `--trace run F t` printed no Fail for an
  atom goal written first. A Redo reopens only the calls it is inside
  (the nearest shallower frame, then the next), not every shallower one.
* **The journal** (1.10.15; TRACING.md, DESIGN-flow.md 9.2):
  `'$trace_window'/4` with `journal(record(F))` writes a line for each
  PORTAL call -- a module call that reaches the world -- and with
  `journal(replay(F))` answers each from its line and runs none. A portal
  is decided by module (`coco_jr_whole`: zigurat, os, process, stream,
  thread, tcp, tls, curl, ray, opencv, torch, tensorflow, numpy, aes, x509
  -- every C predicate of one), by name for the modules that are not
  (`coco_jr_named`: files' twenty, getenv/setenv/unsetenv, statistics/2,
  current_prolog_flag/2, sha_file/3, and format/3 unless its sink is a
  term), and by `coco_m_portal` for a module out of the tree. **A core
  builtin is never one**, nor a load (`use_module/1` reads the program's own
  clauses again in every run). What bites:
  - **The journal is the seam's, and only while a window holds one**: the
    seam's three static hooks are wrapped as the window's run starts and
    put back as it ends (`coco_jr_wrap`), so an untraced run dispatches
    exactly as before, and another thread's machine goes straight through.
  - **A replay is matched by inference, predicate AND call text**: an
    `exit(Goal)` outcome would catch another argument by not unifying, but
    a `fail` has nothing to unify -- the text is the only witness. A replay
    that passes an entry by is caught at the next module call (`portal`
    names that call, its module `unknown`: it was stopped before it ran) or
    at its end (`coco_jr_settle`, `Got` none).
  - **Read the goal BEFORE the call runs**: a caught raise unwinds the heap
    the goal's cell is on, so the text and format/3's sink are taken first.
  - **A replay opens no stream and starts no thread**: a write the replay
    makes to a stream it never opened goes nowhere (`coco_m_replay_sink`),
    and a thread's messages come from the journal.
  - **Floats are exact in it, as everywhere since 1.10.28** (the writer's
    shortest form, below): through 1.10.27 the journal alone wrote 17
    digits (`m->wexact`, gone), and `%.15g` would have made a replayed
    clock another number.
* **A float is written as SWI 9 writes it** (1.10.28, `coco_sb_put_double`
  in lib/term.cicili): the fewest significant digits that read back as the
  same double -- `%.14e`, then 16 and 17, and at 16 the neighbour towards
  the value when the nearest misses (a power of two's lower gap is half its
  upper: 2.0 ** -549 is ...053, SWI's, where the nearest 16 digits are a
  different double; `coco_float_nudge`, whose digits move the other way
  for a negative value -- its first build wrote -2.0 ** -549 in 17) -- set
  out by SWI's rule: `0.000ddd`
  down to a point three places before the digits, `d.ddde-N` past it,
  `ddd.0` up to 15 places, `d.ddde+N` beyond (`1.0e+22`, `1.0e-5`,
  `100000000000000.0`), an infinity `1.0Inf`/`-1.0Inf`, a NaN `1.5NaN`.
  The reader takes `1.0Inf` and `1.5NaN` back (after a fraction and no
  exponent, as SWI: `1.0NaN` is its syntax error), and `-0.0` keeps its
  sign, in the reader and in `-/1` (both did `0 - x`). 21,000 doubles of a
  run are written by swipl to the letter and read back bit for bit
  (`test/files/floats.pl` holds 40 to swipl's text). Not SWI's yet: `inf`
  and `nan` are not evaluable, and term_to_atom/2 reads the first term of
  its text and ignores the rest (`'1.0 x'` is `1.0`). A frozen machine
  still writes `%.17g` (lib/state.cicili).
  **Two floats are one term when their BITS are** (2.1.1, `coco_flt_eq`):
  `0.0 = -0.0` fails, a NaN unifies with itself, `-0.0 @< 0.0`, and a NaN
  sorts before every other number (`coco_flt_order`, which
  `coco_num_order` asks of two floats that do not order as numbers) --
  swipl 9.0.4's answers, `test/files/float_order.pl`. Through 2.1.0 unify,
  the store's matcher and a compiled head compared the doubles, and a NaN,
  equal to every number in the order, left a sort out of order. **A new
  identity test of FLT cells calls `coco_flt_eq`**, never `==` on the
  doubles. Arithmetic compares numbers (`0.0 =:= -0.0`), and **a NaN is
  unordered** (2.1.2, swipl 9.0.4's, `test/files/float_arith.pl`):
  `coco_num_cmp` answers 2 against anything, so `=\=` holds and the other
  five fail, `X =:= X` among them (through 2.1.1 a NaN was equal to every
  number). **`max` and `min` are SWI's `ar_max`/`ar_min`**
  (`coco_num_pick`, which answers which of the two): a NaN passed over,
  -0.0 the smaller zero, of an integer and a float that are equal the
  float, and the one picked as it came, so `max(2, 1.5)` is `2` (it was
  `2.0`); is/2, max_list/2, min_list/2 and aggregate_all/3 each ask it in
  the order of SWI's own clause (`max(H, Max0)` along a list,
  `max(M0, X)` in an aggregate: the order picks which of two NaNs). **A
  new reader of max or min calls `coco_num_pick`, and a new caller of
  `coco_num_cmp` reads its 2.** aggregate_all/3's sum adds integers as
  integers until a float arrives, int_overflow past 64 bits, as sum_list/2
  does (through 2.1.1 in doubles: 2^53 + 1 summed to 2^53, and two halves
  of 2^63 to the least integer), and `sign/1` of a NaN is SWI's one NaN.
  The guards never meet any of it: they take integers alone.
  **A float a function makes is a number or an error** (2.2.0, swipl's
  check_float() under its flags' defaults; cocolog has no flags to change
  them): a NaN raises `evaluation_error(undefined)` (`0.0 / 0.0`,
  `sqrt(-1.0)`), an infinity `float_overflow` (`10.0 ** 400`, `log(0.0)`),
  a number other than zero over a float zero `zero_divisor`; a subnormal is
  a number. `coco_float_ok` asks it of what `+`, `-` and `*` make (the
  macro answers 5), of `/`, `**` and `^`, of sqrt/1, the transcendentals,
  exp/1, log/1 and float/1 (`coco_float_fn`), and first of each float
  OPERAND those take, as swipl's promotion does -- so `1.0Inf ** -1` and
  `sin(1.0Inf)` are float_overflow where libm answers 0.0 and a NaN;
  sum_list/2 and aggregate_all/3's sum ask it of each float sum
  (`coco_l_float_ok`), and max and min of two equal infinities raise
  float_overflow (`coco_num_pick` answers 2; swipl makes the two one type
  and checks the float it makes), aggregate_all/3's first `max(X, X)` among
  them. Unchecked, as in swipl: the sign, `abs`, `-`, `+` and the
  comparisons; integer/1, truncate/1, round/1, floor/1 and ceiling/1, which
  hand a NaN or an infinity back as it came (`coco_float_back`; undefined
  through 2.1.2); and `/` over an infinity, the integer 0 for an integer and
  a signed zero for a float. A power is swipl's ar_pow(): `X ** 0` is the
  integer 1 (a NaN's too), `1 ** Y` 1, `0 ** Y` 0 or a zero divisor,
  `-1 ** N` 1 or -1. Through 2.1.2 each of these was the C answer, the NaN
  or the infinity, and a power with a float in it a float.
  `test/files/float_check.pl` (194 lines) holds it to swipl; 24 arms red.
  **A new evaluable function that makes a float asks `coco_float_ok` of it,
  and of each float it takes.**
* **`>>` and `<<` take any count** (1.14.0, `coco_shift_right` and
  `coco_shift_left` in lib/term.cicili, which both evaluators call --
  `coco_arith` and the guards' runner, written once in kb.cicili and
  emitted three times). A C shift by 64 or more, or by a NEGATIVE count, is
  undefined (C11 6.5.7/3), and x86-64 and aarch64 both take the count
  modulo 64, so the answer was wrong with no error: `1 >> 64` was 1,
  `1 << 1000000` was 1, `-256 >> 66` was -64, and `1 >> -1` was
  `1 >> 63` (cicilang's report, found where a 128-bit significand written
  as its two halves did not move; its own constant folder had the same
  fault). Now SWI's answers, as far as 64 bits carry them: a count past 63
  gives `>>` the sign of its left side (0 or -1), a negative count shifts
  the other way (`1 >> -1` is 2, `4 << -1` is 2), its magnitude tested
  before the negation that the smallest integer would overflow, and a `<<`
  that would lose a bit raises evaluation_error(int_overflow) since 2.0.0
  (`1 << 63`, `3 << 62`; `-1 << 63` is the least integer; through 1.15 a
  61-bit cell wrapped it, and `1 << 64` was 0). The left shift goes through
  u64, because a left shift of a negative value is undefined as well
  (6.5.7/4), and the helpers say a lost bit through their `ovf`. `test/engine.pl`'s `shifts` section holds
  all three paths -- the step, a guard, a goal in place -- to the answers,
  and is red on 1.13.7 for 20 of its 34 rows in each. **A new evaluator of
  a shift calls the two helpers**; neither `(>> a b)` nor `(<< a b)` on
  values a program gave is sound.
* **Integers are 64 bits** (2.0.0; 61 through 1.15, past which arithmetic
  wrapped in silence). A cell holds 61 (INT, tag 2, `coco-fits-cell`); a
  value past them is BOXED, a BIG cell (tag 7) whose payload indexes
  `m->bigs`, i64 (`coco_big_entry`). `coco_new_int` boxes only past the 61
  and `coco_int_val` reads either kind: **canonical by range**, so an INT
  never equals a BIG and two INT cells still compare by word, while two
  BIGs compare by value, as floats do. **A new reader of an integer asks
  `coco-is-int` and `coco_int_val`, never the INT tag alone, and a new
  builder calls `coco_new_int`.** Past 64 bits arithmetic raises
  `evaluation_error(int_overflow)` (`coco_int_overflow`), where SWI makes a
  bignum: `+`, `-` and `*` through `coco_add_ovf`, `_sub_` and `_mul_`
  (`(static) (inline)` over `__builtin_*_overflow`, an add or an imul and a
  `jo`; a 128-bit test made an add nine instructions), `**` and `^`
  (`coco_ipow`), the least integer `//` or `div` -1 and its `-` and `abs`,
  a `<<` that loses a bit, succ/2, plus/3, sum_list/2, numlist/3; a float
  made an integer outside them raises it too (a NaN or an infinity is
  handed back, as swipl's is, since 2.2.0). The reader counts a literal in u64
  (`coco_mag_digit`, `iwide`): past 2^63-1, or 2^63 for a negative one, is
  `integer out of range`, and atom_number/2 and number_codes/2 fail for
  such a numeral. **The guards stop where they cannot decide** -- a result
  past 64 bits, the least integer // -1, its negation, a shift that loses
  a bit, a BIG operand -- and AG_ISF/AG_ISV hand a result past the cell's
  61 bits to the step, which boxes it; GUARDX (`coco_env_guardx`) works on
  the CELLS (A+B is CA-2+CB, A-B CA-CB+2, A*B (CA-2)*B+2), where a 64-bit
  overflow is exactly a result past the 61. The index keys a BIG as 0, as
  FLT and STR (`coco_arg_key`, `coco_cell_key`, `coco_store_arg_key`); the
  tables reclaim `bigs` with the floats and strings (`bb`, `bfree`); a
  frozen machine carries them in a `B` section after `U`, each entry in hex;
  two integers are ordered exactly and an integer and a float as doubles,
  the float first when they are equal (`coco_num_order`, swipl 9.0.4's).
  `bounded` is `true`, `max_integer`/`min_integer` ±2^63 (less one above),
  `max_tagged_integer`/`min_tagged_integer` the cell's 2^60-1 and -2^60. A
  module reads either kind with `coco_m_int` and raises with
  `coco_m_evaluation_error`. `test/engine.pl`'s `integers_64` (and the
  shifts) hold it; twelve arms red; tools/flow/zero.sh against 1.15.0:
  nrev -0.16 %, queens +0.26 %, lookup +0.38 %.
* **A refused allocation raises resource_error(memory)** (1.10.28). A
  doubling refused is tried again with what is needed and a sixteenth
  (`coco_grow_short` for the machine's arrays, `coco_eng_grow` for the
  choices, `coco_store_grow` for the store's), and given, the running
  engine is stopped with `halted` 2 -- through `m->haltp`, which
  `coco_engine_next` sets beside `m->eng`, or the store's `memreq`, which
  `coco_store_put` hands over -- and the loop's top raises
  `error(resource_error(memory), _)` (`coco_halted_step`, weak, so the
  loop pays the test it always paid). There is room left to build the ball
  and unwind; nothing was written wrong, because every growth succeeded. A
  growth the ball or its throw was given less for is the same shortage,
  dropped as it is raised -- not a second raise at the recovery's first
  step.
  findall/3 asks after each result it puts: its engine's next step is
  after the search, never for one with no end. A growth refused outright
  sets `oom` and ends the run with `out of memory` as before (a builder
  that found no room may have written over cell 0). A C buffer refused
  (call/N's arguments, sort's, format's, a module's) raises it too
  (`coco_mem_error`, `coco_m_resource_error`). `test/errors.pl` runs four
  under `ulimit -v 600000`; 1.10.27 ended three with `out of memory` and
  ran the fourth for ever. **The growth is out of line and weak**
  (`coco_grow_slow`, `coco_eng_grow_slow`), the test alone inlined: with
  the fallback's call inlined into every push, clang stopped inlining
  `coco_new_var` and lookup ran 4.2 % more instructions (1.66 million in
  calls to it), and `(static)` lets clang inline it back the same way.
  Weak, against 1.10.27 (`tools/flow/zero.sh`, work less padding): nrev
  +0.63 % (all of it `coco_clause_run_r`, whose heap tests now carry a
  call), queens -2.5 %, lookup -1.6 %.
* **A window asks where it stopped** (1.10.16, D4): `'$trace_window'/4`'s
  `ask(Cond, Holds)` proves Cond in an engine of its own (ten million
  inferences, no collection) between the run's end and the undo, over the
  bindings the run left; Cond's cell is a root beside the goal's
  (`hold[1]`), because a collection on the way to the window moves it.
  `flow_when/4` bisects over runs stopped at `to(I)` and asked -- each a
  child process replaying the probe's journal -- and `flow_why/2`
  (`library/flow/dbgwhy.pl`) reads a failure tree back from the calls: a
  retried clause is entered at the inference of the call whose failure
  retried it (a retry takes none), so that call is the clause BEFORE's.
* **`sort/4` (and so `keysort/2`) is a stable merge sort**; `library(process)`
  spawns with `posix_spawn` (`fork` is refused for a process whose one
  merged mapping exceeds RAM+swap) and RAISES when it cannot spawn.
* **stdout is block-buffered into a pipe**: `flush_output/0` before
  blocking, or a marker never arrives.
* **A grammar rule's leading terminal is stored in its head**, as SWI's
  `optimise_unify` does.
* **The reader is written ONCE and emitted TWICE** (1.10.7): the bodies of
  `coco_parse_term`, `_primary`, `_named`, `_args` and `_list` are macros at
  the top of `lib/syntax.cicili`, emitted as the family every consult uses
  and as the `_p` family that also builds `read_term/3`'s positions; a
  position site is `(if ,P ...)`, which the compiler drops from the first.
  **A change to the parser is a change to the macro**, and a helper both
  families call is `(inline)`. One parser with a flag at each site cost
  consulting the translator 1.3 %; the two cost `coco_next_token` nothing
  and the parser within 0.13 %.
* **Concurrency shares nothing**: a `library(thread)` thread gets its own
  machine, store, engine and database connection; a channel copies terms in
  canonical text. Mutexes and conditions serialise the WORLD (a file, a tcp
  handle, the terminal); an atom names a process-wide lock; use
  `with_mutex/2`. An httpd `workers(N)` request runs through
  `run_isolated/2` (fresh store, its own connection, one commit), so pages
  must be loaded with `use_module` -- consulted or asserted pages are a
  silent 404 in a pool.
* **`library(stream)`** owns the stream table and ISO's stream names
  (`open/3,4`, `set_output/1`, `read_term/3`, …). `format/3` and
  `with_output_to/2` reach it through a sink hook
  (`coco_m_sink_install`); `set_output/1` redirects fd 1 with dup/dup2. The
  stdout sentinel for `format/2` is `(cast size_t -1)`, not 0 (cell 0 is a
  real heap cell). cocolint's X2 trap is lifted by a
  `use_module(library(stream))`, a directive or a goal (2.2.1). **Every
  byte it reads is counted** (`st_count`/`st_uncount`: bytes, characters,
  the line, SWI's column), so `read_term/3` answers `term_position` and
  `subterm_positions` on a pipe too; a seek or a write to an update stream
  leaves the counters behind `ftell`, and `st_pos_sync` counts again from
  the start.

## The document libraries

`library(json)`, `library(xml)`, `library(html)` (with CSS) go both ways:
writers answer CODES, readers take codes or an atom, all six halves are DCGs.
**The round trip is the test** (`test/serialize.pl`). **A code list is a
list**: `str(X)` is how text is said. **They throw rather than guess**, naming
the term. `xml.pl` reads no DTD (XXE is impossible, an undeclared entity is an
error); `html.pl` leaves an unknown entity as text, refuses `</script` inside
`script`/`style`, has no indent option, and is NOT an HTML5 tree builder.
`html.pl` reuses `xml.pl`'s escaper by name; the UTF-8 encoder is copied on
purpose.

## Cryptography and TLS

`sha`, `aes`, `der`, `x509`, `tls` and the clauses-only `library(ca)`:
**arithmetic is bound, grammar is Prolog, policy is clauses.** **Keys are
files, never terms** (a key in an atom would reach the trail, channels and the
store); a pass phrase arrives by `getenv/2`. `X509::issue`'s issuer argument is
a NAME CONFIGURATION, not a certificate. `certificate_public_key` yields the
SPKI's contents; `der_wrap(48, K, S)` puts the header back.

* **A client certificate is optional for TLS and mandatory for
  permissions**: under `SECURITY/PERMISSIONS_MODE` a plain connection reaches
  everything, TLS without a certificate nothing, with one what it grants.
* **Under TLS 1.3 a missing client certificate is not a failed handshake**:
  `SSL_connect` succeeds and the refusal arrives on the first read; a test
  checks what the peer REACHES.
* `library(tls)` is `library(tcp)` with a handshake: the stream stays in the
  module, a handle is a slot, every refusal FAILS (`tls_why/1` says why).
  `library(httpd)` does HTTPS through tagged connections
  (`plain(S)`/`secure(S)`); the peer's identity reaches a page as
  `Tls-Peer-Subject`/`Tls-Peer-Permissions`, stripped from the client's
  request on both transports.
* The one TLS client unit is `client/tls.c` (`coco_client_tls_*`); a failed
  Zeytun fetch prints its reason on stderr.

## The reasoning library and the translator

`library/reasoning/`: `reason.pl` (controlled English as a DCG, questions,
explanations, topics), `normalise.pl` (the generator of tagged training
pairs), `tagger.pl` (a GRU tagger over `tensor_expr`, plus the deterministic
judge `tagger_sane/2` and repair `tg_repair/3`), `translate.pl` (sentences
read into an English-worded IR and written into any lesson's language),
`teach.pl` and `page.pl`. Cases: `test/reason.pl`, `normalise.pl`,
`tagger.pl`, `translate.pl`; lessons 43-46 in `tutorials/library/`.

**Where the data is, and who reads it:**

| path | what | rebuilt by |
|---|---|---|
| `corpus/*.txt` | hand lessons, one sentence a line -- **the TAGGER's corpus** | hand |
| `corpus/extra/<lang>.txt`, `extra/eng-*.dix` | lines and dictionary entries Apertium lacks or gets wrong -- vocabulary only, never read by the tagger, written FIRST | hand |
| `corpus/vocabulary/*.txt` | ~110k Italian and ~139k Spanish lesson lines, committed | `corpus/build.pl` from `corpus/raw/` (`tools/corpus/fetch.sh`, not committed) |
| `generated/`, `model.rows` | the training pairs and the shipped model, committed | `tools/tagger/train.sh` |
| `lexicon/*.txt` | WordNet and census words, committed | `tools/lexicon/build.sh` |

* **A change to `corpus/*.txt` is a data change for the tagger**: regenerate
  `generated/` and `model.rows`, and expect a minority shape to re-roll. A
  word that is vocabulary rather than a shape goes in `corpus/extra/`. A
  training is deterministic, so retraining unchanged data fixes nothing.
* **Rebuild the vocabularies after the LAST line of `extra/`**:
  `test/translate.pl`'s `build` section rebuilds the Spanish file in a scratch
  corpus (with `raw/` and `extra/` symlinked) and requires it byte for byte.
  Read a rebuilt vocabulary for what it LOST (a set diff), not only what it
  gained.
* **A line of `extra/` has two readers**: it comes first for its WORD and
  for its MEANING, so it moves the reader of one language and the writer of
  the other. Say the dictionary's own word again first where the line must
  not become the word written. **A line that gives a COMMON word a second
  meaning makes every sentence with that word read it twice over** (`The word
  "che" means "which".` made the old translator 11.2 % dearer over the
  controls on the new store and the six heaviest sentences 2.6 times, and the
  factor multiplies: cecchi 8 has two `che` and rose 3.9 times, the other
  meaning being tried again on every failing road): find such a line by
  teaching a store without each group of the new lines (50 s a store) and
  counting the heaviest sentences, and where the second sense reads as the
  first, let the code take it from the first (`tr_which_asks/2`). **An
  elision a lesson states is read AND
  written**: `"dev'" is the elision of "deve".` makes the reader take `dev'essere`
  apart (tr_expand/3, for a verb form or a question word only: an article's,
  a pronoun's and a preposition's keep theirs, which their readers ask for),
  and made the Italian writer elide every `come` before a vowel -- the data
  column found `com'assicurano i palestinesi`, `paesi com'Alemania` and
  `considerato com'il Van Gogh` in ten sentences of the old controls. The
  writer elides such a word only where the lesson says what the elided form
  comes before (`"com'" comes before "è".`, as for a pronoun's;
  tr_elision_written/3), which no lesson says yet.
* **A store learns only the lines it lacks**, appended: an ORDER is a
  property of a teach, not of a line. A data fix is proved on a store taught
  from the rebuilt vocabulary. Teaching both languages into one fresh
  `--embed` store takes ~40 s on 1.10.0 (18 s and 23 s, four vCPUs; it took
  ~11 and ~18 minutes), so **try an ORDER effect on a fresh store before an
  `extra/` line is final**: a working store that had lines appended in
  another order showed a first meaning the fresh one did not (`de riesgo`,
  `cualquiera`).
* **The reasoning libraries read both text units** (1.13.2; bytes were the
  default through 1.x, characters are since 2.0.0). Every
  clause that names an accent or a mark by its UTF-8 BYTES (`[195, B]`,
  `[226, 128, 156]`, `[194, 171]`) has a TWIN that names the CODE POINT
  (`rt_upper_cp/1`, `[8220]`, `[171]`) in reason.pl (the tokeniser,
  `rt_tokens/2`, `rt_run/3`, `rt_letter_next/1`, `rt_word_case/2`,
  `rt_lowers/2`, `rl_vowel/1`, `rl_letter/1`), translate.pl (`tr_cap/2`,
  `tr_cap_head/2`, `tr_lower_codes/2`, `tr_capitals/3`, `tr_capital_start/1`,
  `tr_small_code/2`, `tr_unaccent_codes/2`, `tr_quote_mark/4`,
  `tr_speech_mark/4`, `tr_has_dash/1`, `tr_mid_marks/2`, `tr_inside_dashes/2`,
  `tr_pre_words/2`, `tr_written_number/4`, `tr_number_written/4`),
  normalise.pl (`ng_cap/2`) and corpus/build.pl (`cb_lower_codes/1`). **A twin
  on a code past 255 needs no test** (no byte is so big); **a twin on a code
  of 128..255 asks `rt_chars/0` AFTER its numbers matched**, because there the
  readings meet: 195 is the lead byte of `é` and the code point of `Ã`, and
  226, the lead byte of every dash and quotation mark, the code point of `â`.
  Where a clause can be written with a constant head, the twin is one (no
  inference is spent in bytes). **A new clause that names an accent or a mark
  by a number gets its twin in the same edit**, and a probe in
  test/translate.pl's `newspaper_units` (two children, one per unit; 49
  probes, an arm per rule, 25 of them, each red). The controls on ONE binary
  (1.13.0, KB86, 87 files, 2016 sentences): the translator as it was changed
  208 sentences under characters (188 refused, 20 other texts, +20.7 % of the
  inferences); the one with the twins changes none in either unit, +0.052 % of
  the inferences in bytes and +0.026 % in characters. NOT migrated, and the
  controls found no difference: `atom_length/2` and `sub_atom/5` over an
  accented word count characters in one unit and bytes in the other (the
  thresholds on a stem's length in the clitic rules), and
  `upcase_atom/2`/`downcase_atom/2` change an accented capital in characters
  only (`tr_city_name/1`, `tr_abbreviation_end/1`). Characters is the
  default since cocolog 2.0.0, so the byte clauses and the tests of
  `rt_chars/0` can go -- the reasoning library's change, on its own number;
  until then a program that asks for bytes reads them as before.
* **Find a translator cost with the flow profile, then bisect it** (1.11.4).
  `cocolog -s tools/flow/debug.pl -- GOAL library/reasoning/translate.pl BASE
  embed=STORE cache=DIR profile=true txt=true from=I to=J` over several
  windows of a few thousand steps spread along a run (a refusal of
  65 million steps, say) gives BASE.prof, and a call there is ONE
  step, which is its whole self cost: rank the predicates by CALLS, then
  by their callers. (The library's unit is the STEP, its texts say so since
  1.13.6, and each profile view says how many of a window's steps were
  inferences: a call of true/0 or =/2 is a step and no inference.) Since
  1.11.10 `profile=all` writes the callers, the goals asked again and the
  steps by what took them (constructs included) into BASE.prof -- no script
  over BASE.txt -- and `windows=N` records N windows along the run, J at a
  time, their profiles added up; `svg=false xml=false` for a profile alone.
  Since 1.13.3 `profile=time` (and `all`) writes where the window's TIME
  went, the probe run under a clock read at every step: a count finds the
  cheap step taken a million times, time the one step that costs a
  thousand (a sort, a findall/3's copying, a store's lookup); since 1.15.0
  each row ends ` @W:S`, where its largest call is (window W, step S: a
  window of a few thousand steps recorded around S reads the call with its
  arguments), and `profile=run` (asked by name; not in `all`) writes each
  predicate's self time over the WHOLE run, a probe of its own under the
  clock from the first step, about twice the run's time. A window of
  100 000 steps far along the translator takes ~30 s that way (100 s with every document
  through 1.11.9, whose matcher alone took 36). Half of the inferences were the lexicon lookup layer
  (tr_solve/1, tr_memo/4 and what they call), and its four wastes were each a
  few per cent: `member/2` on a LIST WALKS IT (a clause per element) where the
  first argument is given -- tr_class_of/2 over its fourteen classes, 4 % of
  all inferences; tr_memo/4 read the generation through a predicate and
  compared what a unification does; the lesson's predicate name was built
  through four calls; tr_language/1 is three inferences where the read in
  place is one. An edit that replaces calls by an if-then-else moves nothing
  (the construct is a step too: tr_solve/1's rewrite saved +0), and the
  controls say so in inferences, not the clock -- ask the clock afterwards
  (five alternating pairs, 6 % less user time).
  **Round two (1.11.5) took the layer's idioms, and found them in the same
  windows**: BASE.txt parsed for the CALLERS of a predicate (the parent is the
  nearest line above with a smaller indent) and for the goals ASKED AGAIN --
  in a window of 100 000 inferences 1 528 tr_solve/1 calls were 391 distinct
  goals (74 % repeats) and 648 tr_class_of/2 calls were 71 pairs of a word
  and a class. A repeat is not a memo's to catch: a hit of tr_memo_w/5 costs
  11-13 inferences against 19 for the lesson, and a memo of tr_class_of/2 cost
  37 where the lesson's own answer costs 35 -- it was tried and left out.
  What paid was the idioms: `tr_language/1` is 7 inferences (the if-then-else,
  the catch/3, the read, the `true`), the plain read is 1, and
  `catch(nb_getval(K, V), _, R)` is 3. So the language and the generation are
  MADE WHEN THE LIBRARY LOADS (`:- nb_setval('$tr_language', none),
  nb_setval('$tr_gen', 0).`; tr_memo_reset/0 checks the language too) and the
  hot sites read them plain: tr_solve/1, tr_is/3, tr_lexeme/4, tr_form/5,
  tr_coord/2, tr_memo_w/5. A site that may meet a machine that never loaded
  the library keeps tr_language/1, which answers `none`. tr_prove/2 is gone
  (tr_lesson/2's first clause is `none`); the rule lookup is a plain call of
  the dynamic `lesson/2`, which never raises; the fact call is its own
  catch/3, not tr_solve_plain/1's two steps; the three wrappers are clauses
  with head patterns where an if-then-else asked `atom/1` of what the head
  already holds. A failed lookup went from 29 to 19 inferences, a found one
  from 28 to 20: the 87 controls 4 879 595 021 -> 3 448 261 913 (-29.3 %),
  every status and text the same. **The clock fell less than the count**: the
  eco control 214 939 001 -> 146 057 424 inferences (-32 %) and 17.44 -> 15.77
  s of user time (-9.6 %, five pairs of five), because what is left is a
  memo table COPIED out of its global at every hit (below) and not a step.
  tools/flow/chart.pl finds the clauses an insertion splits (`not together`:
  tr_time_phrase/1, tr_comps_out/7 were found so, 38 old ones remain).
* **Memory**: a teach sat at 4-9 GB resident before the heap collector of
  1.8.36 and peaks near 1 GB since (the Spanish pass, measured on 1.8.40), a
  tagger training is near 10 GB, `test/tagger.pl` alone; on a 14-16 GB box run
  the big ones apart -- a cocolint run
  beside a teach was OOM-killed (exit 137) when the linter still reached
  10 GB; the corpus lint peaks near 3.5 GB now. A killed process never
  flushes. **An arm that removes half of a coupled change can loop and grow
  its heap past 13 GB** (a clause left with an unbound variable): run arms
  under `ulimit -v`, and never beside a teach -- the OOM killer took both.
  `tagger_tag_all/3` keeps a batch's intermediate tensors: tag big grids a
  sentence at a time.
* **A small case lesson reproduces a fault only when it gives the word every
  role the vocabulary does** (and every form: a lesson with one participle
  form cannot test agreement). A guard is proved by an ARM that puts the
  first cut back and goes red; a guard whose arm is green proves nothing.
* **A right text is not a right IR.** English IS the IR; translate into
  English to see what crossed. A refusal with `unknown: []` is a missing
  SHAPE; one that reads into English and refuses into the target is a target
  vocabulary gap.
* **The owner's sample loop** (one article at a time, alternating directions,
  until an article needs no change): build the shapes; add `extra/` lines;
  rebuild and teach a fresh store; then the CONTROLS -- every earlier article
  plus Tatoeba's 400, this translator against the last version's on the one
  store, twice -- and the DATA COLUMN, the last version's translator on its
  own store against the new store, the only place a line of data shows. Fix
  every regression, find every cost by hunk bisection (the heaviest sentences
  of a pass, written to a file and counted over a copy of the library per
  rule: two seconds a copy, where a pass of the controls is two and a half
  minutes), add a section to `test/translate.pl` and to lesson 46, record the
  stated costs. An arm is the same copy run through the section: **one whose
  removal makes the section RAISE has no FAIL line**, so read the last line
  (`GREEN` or `RED`) and count the `ERROR` lines as well. Controls run
  BEFORE the commit. **Merge `origin/master` before the teach** when it moved
  the engine, so the numbers belong to the binary that is committed, and **run
  the whole `test/translate.pl` (half a minute on 1.15.0) before it**: a section
  alone cannot see an older section's check -- the Cecchi section was green for
  days and the whole case had eight red, and the Tempi section's `Persino ...`
  before a subject read `Hasta entonces el perro duerme` as `even the dog`.
  Read the controls' TEXTS, not only their counts: they found a pronoun lost
  (`lo`), a committee made the object, `ma non` written last, a sentence that
  ran to the 300 M inference limit and `l'anima` as `lo anima`; and sum the
  counts by hunk -- a clause that reads the phrase's words a second time at
  every place that read nothing cost 3 %.
  **A refusal can hide a wrong reading**: English refused a clause with no
  subject, and giving it `they` for a verb of saying turned `dijo el
  presidente de la Generalitat, que inauguró` (the speaker read as an object)
  into `they said the chairman` -- look at the IR of what a fix now writes,
  not only at its text, and at a sentence the fix was not made for.
  **Diff the first word of every meaning** between the committed vocabulary
  and the rebuilt one (class and English meaning to first word, gender
  ignored: the writer takes the first noun of a meaning whatever its gender):
  an `extra/` line, a dictionary entry marked `RL` among them, is the first
  word of its meaning wherever it lands in the file. The Abogacía report's
  lines made a feminine `consigliera` the first Italian noun for an adviser
  (every `conseller` was `la consigliera`; the feminines mean a `councilwoman`
  now, so a woman crosses as a woman and the masculine is the adviser),
  `letrado` the first Spanish noun
  for a lawyer (`su letrado`), `president` the first for a chairman, and
  `The word "quienes" follows the preposition.` the relative a Spanish writer
  puts after EVERY preposition (`en el que` was `en quienes`, in 19 sentences
  of the data column); the dictionary's own word is said again first, and a
  line that a reader needs and a writer must not use stays unsaid.
* **Open leads, recorded and not done**: the builder calls a noun a person
  only by its first English word; the upstream verb table
  has `scaping`/`leaved`; `No comas el pan.` reads the subjunctive before the
  negative imperative; `pronto` after a verb crosses as `immediate`; `ir a`
  and an infinitive is the near future and reads as a verb of motion, with
  the infinitive's clitic on it (`nos vamos a quedar` is `ci andiamo a
  rimanere`); Spanish `advertir a los suyos` takes a direct object in
  Italian (`avvertì ai suoi`); `da` before a bare noun is `desde` (`una fama
  desde hábil niño`); `portarsela dietro` is an idiom and crosses word by word
  (`traersela atrás`); a contraction before a quoted article drops
  the opening mark (`de "la casa"` is `della casa"`); a lesson line gives a
  word ONE sense in both numbers (`competencias` are powers, `la competencia`
  the rival firms, and the line for the first moved the second); `su` for the
  owners of a plural crosses as `il suo` (`su futuro` of the shops);
  `afectar a` keeps its `a` (`influire negativamente alle centrali`); an
  adjective after two coordinated nouns agrees with the nearest (`centrali e
  gruppi di spesa spagnola`); `se si elevasse` crosses as `si se elevó`, the
  imperfect subjunctive written as a past indicative; `del quale` is `de
  quién`; `un altro milione` is `un otro millón`; `insomma` at the head of a
  clause is written at its end (`en resumen`); `in termini percentuali` is
  `en porcentajes plazos`; the clitic `ne` crosses as `lo` (`ne potranno
  beneficiare` is `lo podrán beneficiar`); `da` after coordinated participles
  is `desde`; an adjective after a quoted noun agrees with the nearest noun
  outside the marks (`"reddito minimo di inserimento" francese` is
  `francesa`, `si chiama "minimo vitale"` is `se llama "mínima vital"`);
  English writes `Non sono pochi` as `Few are not` and moves a quotation's
  marks to the edges of its phrase; a name of one capital word and an
  adjective (`Roma antica`) is not read; `participar en` is `partecipare
  nel` (`partecipò nell'attentato`) and `a poca distancia de` `a poca
  distanza di`; `fue abatido` is `era abbattuto` (the lesson's past of `è`
  is `era`); `cerca de su casa` is `vicino la sua casa` (the hand lesson's
  `vicino` first, the `de` dropped) and `dentro de` a vehicle `entro`; `su
  esposa` is `la sua moglie`; `huían del lugar` is `fuggirono del luogo`
  (`de` after a verb of motion is not `da`); `pasado` before a day is
  `passata domenica`; `ayer` after the verb is written last (`in questa
  zona ieri`); `heridas` after `causando` is the singular `ferita`; `de
  gravedad` is `di gravità`; `murió un joven` reads the subject as an
  object, as the lesson does not call `morir` intransitive: Italian writes
  it as read and English refuses it (17 and 21 of the Israel report); a day
  fronts a relative clause only as an article and its noun (`que todos los
  domingos visita`, `que cada domingo visita` and `que el 12 de enero
  compró` are refused); `su` after a verb of writing is `en` (`scritto su
  Montanelli`, not `sobre`); the imperfect crosses as the preterite
  (`sapevo` is `supe`, `mi piaceva` `me gustó`); `lo conosco` is `lo sé`
  (the clitic does not say whether it stands for a person or a fact), and so
  is the object of a relative (`il giornalista che io abbia conosciuto` is
  `he sabido`); `la prima di molte lezioni` reads `prima di` as the
  preposition `before` and `il primo era buono` reads `era` as a noun;
  `Dare ordini` reads the infinitive as a subject and `ordini` as its verb
  (`Dar ordena`); `piano` is `plan` after an ordinal (`al terzo piano`, `al
  tercer plan`) and `campioni alimentari` `campeones`; `darsi da fare`,
  `darlo a vedere`, `non ci sono riuscito`, `adesso che ci penso`, `passare
  per la testa`, `in fondo` and `all'opera` cross word by word; a clitic
  cluster is not rewritten (`decirlelo`, `se la ricordava` is `si la
  recordó`); `dei libri da non scrivere` is `desde no escribir`; `Sapendo
  che dorme, lui mangia` reads `lui` as the gerund's object clitic; `ancora
  quindi più cara` after a comma reads `ancora` as the noun (`ancla`); the
  role after `da` is written `as student` into English, with no article; an
  apposition keeps no gender (`la sua compagna` is `su compañero`); `tutti
  quelli` is `everyone those` into English, never `all of those`; `esperar
  que` is `attende che` (hopes that) and `apostar por` `scommettere per`;
  `gran` before a vowel is written whole (`gran asse`, where Italian has
  `grande asse`); a subjunctive after `impiden que` is written as the
  indicative (`che ... è continuo`, `che si permette`); `también` and
  `siempre` are written last (`il passaggio di Vintró anche`); a dash aside
  inside a quotation is written after the whole sentence, outside its mark
  (`"La peatonalización - añade - complementará ..."`); `fincas` are farms,
  `acogerse a` is `riceversi a` and `contar con` `contare con`; `Rambla` at
  the head of a sentence is the common noun (`Passeggio senz'ostacoli`); a
  capital word the lesson knows as an adjective crosses by its meaning unless
  the lesson says it is a name (`"meridiana" is a name.`); English refuses a
  null third-person subject (`asegura`, `añade`), and does not write a
  relative clause `en que esté permitida` or one with a participle and its
  agent after `contará con`: four of the Clot report's sentences stay out of
  English; from the Quartieri report (Italian into Spanish): the words
  `linguaggi` (`idiomas`), `laboratori` (`laboratorios`), `strada` after
  `teatro di` (`carretera`), `sfilata` (`intestino`), `palco` (`etapa`),
  `costumi` (`costumbres`), `opere` (`óperas`), `pannelli` (`tableros`),
  `tele` (`lonas`), `svolgersi` (`actuar`), `contributo libero`
  (`contribución gratuita`), `impegneranno` (`comprometerán`), `saranno
  insieme` (`serán juntos`), `per una settimana` (`para una semana`) and
  `ragazzi` (`niños`; `chico` first broke `bambino`) are the dictionary's
  first word, not the news's; `a` before a place keeps its `a` (`a Harlem`,
  `a Tor Bella Monaca`, where Spanish says `en`: the lesson has no notion of a
  place), a country keeps its article (`desde la Italia`) and a name is
  translated word by word where its words are common (`Alta tensione` is
  `Alto voltaje`, `Sud Africa` `Sur Africa`); a quotation, its verb and then
  the speaker (`..." spiega Nicoletta Gaida`) writes the speaker as an object
  (`explica a Nicoletta Gaida`) and the apposition after it keeps no gender
  (`ideatrice` is `creador`); a quotation inside a quotation (`come
  "delinquenti"`) loses its place; `che da anni coinvolge ... e dal Sud
  Africa l'amajica ...` is one relative clause to the end of its bracket, so
  `desde hace años` is written at the end of the bracket; `nuovi linguaggi del
  disagio giovanile in cui immergersi` attaches `in cui` to `disagio`
  (`en el que`); `"quartieri"` in lowercase marks is translated (`"barrios"`)
  where the lesson names it only with a capital; a name that begins with a
  word the lesson knows (`Lord of the Rings`) is still refused, and `&`
  between lowercase words is dropped (`pane & vino`). A bare noun before
  `di` no longer takes the gender of the noun after it unless it says a part
  (`tasse d'iscrizione` is `impuestos de inscripción`, like the first
  `tasse`; it was `tasas`, by the gender of `inscripción`). English writes
  a weekday with no capital (`thursday 20`), and refuses sentence 20 (`Inoltre un convegno
  (giovedì 20), proiezioni, la mostra dei Murales, ...`: a heading made of
  `La mostra` alone is refused into English).
  The Abogacía report (Spanish into Italian and into English) is read and
  written whole, and its leads are fixed (1.10.3, 172 checks over it). What
  it still leaves: `Se la cava.` has no `cavare` in either dictionary (and an
  idiom of several words crosses word by word); `Os lo digo` was `Ti lo dico`
  -- the lesson language had no second person plural (`coméis` was no word,
  `os` and `vi` were `you`, and the IR's `you` had no number: settled by the
  Tatarella interview below); English writes
  `Lo dejo comer` as `I leave him to eat`, `Lo veo venir` as `I see him to
  come` and `Hago comer el pan al perro` as `I make to eat the bread to the
  dog`: what makes, lets or watches somebody do something is a construction
  of its own -- the doer of the infinitive has no term in the IR (the clitic
  or the `a` phrase stands beside the infinitive), a lesson names no such
  verbs, and `dejar` has no meaning of its own before an infinitive;
  `se limitó a decir` is `limited to say` (English wants `himself` and `to
  saying`, and the IR's noun carries no gender for the pronoun); `más de lo
  que recibe ahora` is `more than the one that receives` (the IR does not
  tell `lo que`, what, from `el que`); the clitic after another clitic or a
  reflexive is read as a thing in English (`me lo apunto` is `I note it`,
  `te lo digo` `I say it to you`), which a person is not (`se lo llevaron`,
  took him away); the Spanish `-ra` form is read as the imperfect it stands
  for after `si`, `como si`, `sin que`, and so it is in the literary
  indicative past of a relative clause or after `después de que` (`donde en
  1988 lograra`, `después de que la lista acusara`: `otteneva`, `accusava`
  where the preterite was; two sentences of the controls, against the many
  it mends: `como si eran pocos`, `si teníamos más`, `sin que figuraban`);
  and the comma before a preposition and its relative is lost
  where the piece has other commas (`reivindicó, ayer, un trato mejor para
  los abogados, a quienes ...` reads `... per gli avvocati a cui ...`:
  keeping it was tried twice and costs the Valencia report's second 1.7
  million of its 9 and the festival report's last 0.4 million of its 3.5).
  The rest of its English is the dictionary's (`a favor de` is `to favour
  of`, `desleales` `disloyals`, `efectuadas` `effected`). **English writes a
  number in its own style** between itself and a language of the decimal
  comma (`tr_decimal_comma/1`: `5.000 millones` is `5,000 million`, `3,5` is
  `3.5`, `10.30` an hour stays; the reader notes the text's style in
  `$tr_numsrc`, the writer swaps the marks of a NUMBER only, and two such
  languages keep their digits), a magnitude after a count singular with no
  `of` (`tres millones de perros` is `three million dogs`), no article before
  a percentage, the adverbs of time and focus before the verb (`also`,
  `always`, `never`: `en_mid_adverb/1`; after a copula or a modal that stands
  alone, in the tail of a question) and `more than`, `about`, `only` before
  the phrase they say how much of (`en_object_adverb/1`). A word with two
  meanings that no SHAPE chooses between still has one: `justamente` is
  justly before an adjective or a participle (`The adjectival adverb
  "justamente" means "justly".`) and precisely elsewhere, as `supone` is
  supposes before `que`; **a meaning the lesson gives a class of its own
  (`intransitive`, `progressive`, `clausal`, `adjectival`) is linked to the
  word's class too, in the order it is said, so the plain meaning is said
  first (again), or the class's meaning becomes the default**
  (`tr_mean_links/3`).
  The Makula interview (VIT-9381..9414, Italian into Spanish: 34 of 34 on a
  fresh store, 16 of 34 before; into English 26 of 34, 15 before) leaves: `per tirar su
  una persona che sta per annegare` is `estirar en una persona que está para
  ahogar`; `fuori dall'acqua` is `fuera desde el agua`; `che ti possa salvare`
  after a negation is `que te puede salvar` (the relative clause's
  subjunctive); `sia stata colta anche lei da sincope` is `la haya sido
  sorprendida también desde síncope`; `non conta nulla che dopo venga portata
  nel miglior ospedale al mondo` is `no cuenta nulo que es traída en el
  hospital mejor al mundo después`; `entro un minuto` is `antes de un minuto`;
  `anche`, `sicuramente` and `también` stand last where Spanish puts them
  after the verb; `Cos'altro le devo dire?` (what else) is REFUSED now -- the
  `¿Cosa debe otro decir?` it was had `otro` for a subject, and a question
  word with `altro` is a shape of its own (`qué más`); English refuses eight
  (4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 27, 32), most for the third person nobody names,
  which it refuses on purpose. The angled marks come back mixed, an opening `«`
  and a closing `”` (`«Il cane dorme”, dice il gatto.`), in bytes and in
  characters alike (the cause is not looked for).
  The Hotel Arts auction (CESS-CAST-P-20011202-66, 17 sentences, Spanish into
  Italian: 15 of 17 on a fresh store, 6 before; into English 15 of 17, 5
  before; reasoning 1.0.1). It needed these SHAPES, each with its arm red:
  a one of a plural for a subject (`Uno de sus principales accionistas es La
  Caixa`: `uno` is the first person of `unir` too, `tr_part_of_subject/1`); a
  phrase with no article between two dashes after a noun or a name, a name
  with a bracket in it (`- - Strategic Hotel Capital (SHC) - -`), the closing
  dash that ends the sentence, a relative clause between dashes that ends it;
  who said so right after a bracket, and the relative clause after the
  comment taken into it (`(288,4 millones de euros), según informó ayer la
  agencia Efe, que cita fuentes`); an adjective before a date's day (`el
  pasado 11 de septiembre`) and the article chosen for the DAY (`dell'8
  settembre`, `del 1 settembre`); a silent h (`l'hotel`, `nell'hotel`,
  `l'ha`: Italian and Spanish only, English keeps `a hotel`); a list that a
  `between` opens keeps its commas together; a noun the lesson states in both
  genders is written in the gender of its meaning (`el capital` the money,
  `la capital` the city: `tr_meaning_gender/5`, the writer's half of
  `tr_gender_links/3`); an adjective after a name that stands right after its
  determiner is the name's (`la Barcelona olímpica`); a word that begins the
  purpose, straight before an infinitive and after a noun or an adjective, is
  no verb (`un solar apto para levantar otro hotel`); an adjective that does
  not agree with its noun in number keeps its own (`agrd/3`: `un espacio de
  oficinas anexo`, `fuentes del sector conocedoras`); a word the lesson says
  is a name is one with its capital inside a phrase (`el grupo inversor
  catalán Metrópolis`). It needed these WORDS in `extra/` (the two readers: a
  line moves the reader of one language and the writer of the other):
  `inmueble`/`immobile` (real estate), `hotelero`/`alberghiero`,
  `preacuerdo`/`preaccordo`, `fondo` (fund, not the background), `fuente`
  (source, not the fountain), `inversor`/`investitore`, `conocedor`, `cinco
  estrellas`, the masculine `capital`/`capitale` (share capital), `anexo`,
  `solar`/`terreno edificabile`, `apto`/`idoneo`, `aspira` (aspires),
  `empresaria`/`imprenditrice`, `sede` before `quartier`, `albergo`, `banca`
  before `argine`, `acquisto` before `spesa`, `edificio`, `gestione`,
  `filiale`, `passato` after its noun, and the two names `Hotel Arts` and
  `Metrópolis`. The CONTROLS (cocolog 1.13.6, store KB93, 89 count files, 2 050
  sentences): the last version's translator against this one, 24 sentences in
  8 files read differently -- 16 in the report's two files, and 8 elsewhere
  (carrefour 22 and 23, e_senegal 26, fiat 11 and 16, israel 15, mobile 9,
  senegal 23: an adjective agreeing with its noun, `gruppi d'acquisto
  spagnoli`, `forze di sicurezza palestinesi`; `l'hanno`; `del capitale più
  prezioso`; English `a competitive Senegal`), all better -- and the
  inferences fall 0.89 % (3 595 025 781
  to 3 563 106 210), 0.0056 % without the report's files; bytes and characters
  read every sentence alike (0 differ, the characters 0.024 % fewer). **The
  binaries of 1.13.3 and 1.13.6 give the same texts and the same inference
  counts to the unit on both translators** (1.13.4's catch/3 frame, 1.13.5's
  `=/2`, 1.13.6's names changed nothing the translator counts). The report's
  tenth sentence costs what it did, 119.9 million inferences to its refusal
  (119.1 for the last version); an alternative that let a comma follow the
  closing dash made it 42.0 and was taken out, below. The DATA COLUMN (the
  last version's translator on its own store, KB86, against this one on the
  new): 51 sentences in 20 files, 27 outside the report's, each a word of the
  report's lines said first -- `fuentes` are sources (5 English sentences, not
  fountains), `fondo` is a fund (4: e_clinton 5 and 12, e_lotr 4, e_mobile 3),
  `acquisto`/`d'acquisto` (3 and the purchasing groups of carrefour), `passato`
  after its noun (clot 6, puigbo 4 and 7), `empresaria` (letter 3), `capital`
  (e_fiat 5 and 16) -- and the 8 of the code. THE STATED COSTS: eco 11,
  `Ma immobile non voleva dire piatta`, was `inmóvil` and is `inmueble` (and
  English `real estate`): the line that makes `immobile` the noun the report
  writes makes a bare `immobile` the noun in the reader as well -- a bare word
  is read as a noun where the lesson has one, and the adjective said first
  (the dictionary's own, `motionless`) was tried and changes nothing; and the
  masculine `capital` is `share capital` in English. **A comma right after the
  closing dash is NOT let through** (the guard's sentence, B6): the first cut
  took `- -,` and the Spanish store read `el fondo - - Strategic - -, aliado
  con un consorcio, duerme` as a piece with no verb and `duerme` its
  imperative -- `dormi` -- where the last version refused it; no hand lesson
  reproduces it (it has no imperative), the guard pins the refusal. The
  report LEAVES: sentence 10 (`el fondo participado por Prudential y
  Goldman Sachs - - Strategic Hotel Capital (SHC) - -, aliado con un
  consorcio español integrado por ... Metrópolis (en el que participa la
  familia Lara, propietaria del grupo editorial Planeta)`), refused: a dashed
  aside followed by an adjective or a participle phrase, with or without the
  comma, is no noun phrase (`tr_np/3` takes an aside token only last, and the
  gloss clause for a bracket before an adjective would write the name between
  the participle and its complement; the aside after it, `app(app(NP,
  dashed, N), aside, Comps)`, is the shape to build), and a bracket after a
  name that opens on a relative clause loses its marks (`Metrópolis in cui
  partecipa la famiglia Lara proprietaria del gruppo editoriale Pianeta`,
  where `Planeta` is a name and is written as the planet); sentence 14 is a
  defect of the source, two of its four dashes are lost (`en España - - más
  de 80.000 millones de pesetas (...) a finales de 1998 como al valor
  contable de los activos 68.700 millones (...) - -`) and no reading puts
  them back. Of the 15 it reads, what is not right: `Londres` stays (a
  capitalised word the lesson knows after a preposition is a name, and there
  is no city by the vocabulary; `in Londres` is `a Londra`), `in Stati Uniti`
  is `negli Stati Uniti` (a country keeps its article in Italian), `cambiar
  de propietario` is `cambierà di proprietario` (Italian says `cambierà
  proprietario`) and `comprar a` writes `al gruppo` (`dal`), `uno de los
  mayores` after `banco` is `uno dei maggiori` where `banca` is feminine (the
  gender of an elided `uno` follows the noun the sentence names, which the
  lesson does not carry), `otro hotel` after a verb is `altro albergo` (`un
  altro`), `terreno inmobiliario` is `terreno immobiliare` (`campo`), a
  relative clause between dashes in a subject writes the pronoun again in
  English (`that they house`), `anexas` after a plural subject is read as a
  verb form (`Las galerías anexas son grandes` is `Le gallerie attaccano sono
  grandi`), `una casa de Pedro cansada duerme` is refused, and a weekday
  before a date's day in front of the clause (`El jueves 9 de marzo el hotel
  cambió de dueño`) is written after the clause with the day and no article
  (`... 9 marzo giovedì`).
  The Tempi del governo report (VIT-9673..9712, 40 sentences, Italian into
  Spanish: 39 of 40 on a fresh store, 28 with the new store alone, 13 before;
  into English 36 of 40, 25 and 11; reasoning 1.0.2). It needed these SHAPES,
  each with its arm red (test/translate.pl's `newspaper_tempi`: 60 checks, 48
  arms; a guard stays only where its arm goes red, and the guards of the
  reporting clause before a colon and of the perfect cleft had none): a name
  the lesson states, before a comma, takes no comma into its run of words
  (`dei cristiano democratici Casini, Mastella, D'Onofrio e del popolare
  Sanza`: `tr_stated_run` asked each word through `forall(member(w(X, C),
  Run), ...)`, whose pattern a comma does not match, so the comma was never
  asked); a capital `D'` before a capitalised word is a surname's particle
  (`Massimo D'Alema`, `Tommaso D'Aquino`, `tr_elision_names0/2`; the small
  `d'` is the preposition still, `il governo d'Alema`); two names with a dash
  between them after a noun are one name (`colloquio Berlusconi - D'Alema`,
  `tr_dash_names/3`), and a bare noun and a name are a heading; a
  demonstrative and an article at the head of a piece have their copula read
  in (`Questo il testo del documento`, `tr_demonstrative_copula/3`; a
  demonstrative that a verb follows is the subject); a quotation right after a
  verb of saying, with no mark between them, is what the verb says (`il Polo
  ha risposto "vedo"`); the word for `all` before a bare singular noun is one
  phrase with it (`con tutta evidenza`, `tr_np/3`; before an article it is the
  pronoun, as it was); a noun that is the first person of a verb, before
  `che`, starts a clause (`credo che stavolta ...`, `tr_first_person_that/2`);
  a day opens the clause of `quando` (`tr_nested_front/3`), `quando` is no
  adjective of the day after it (`tr_adj_word/2`), and an adverb right before
  `quando`, or before the `o` of an either-or, leads the sentence in; a
  heading of bare nouns in a list (`Forzatura, distinguo e bacchettata.`,
  `tr_bare_title/3`; two nouns joined by `e` are no list); among nouns that
  are adjectives too, the one that has a plural to be heads a phrase that a
  plural numeral opens (`due sole alternative`, `tr_plural_hint/4`); an adverb
  between the auxiliary and its participle keeps a perfect infinitive (`di non
  aver affatto abbracciato`), and `già` is an adverb of degree before a
  participle; a day and a phrase that names, the verb left out (`Martedì tutti
  attorno al tavolo.`); a bare noun and an adjective with its intensifier
  (`Mediazione particolarmente faticosa se ...`, which joins the clause after
  it, `tr_join_left/5`; `Big house.` stays refused); a plural noun and its
  phrase of `of`, at the head of a piece with no other verb (`Sviluppi delle
  trattative in atto ...`, `tr_noun_heading_start/1`: `sviluppi` is a command
  too); a verb of two words with an adverb between them (`risente invece del
  punto di vista`, `tr_multi/2`; before an infinitive `invece di` is the
  preposition); a verb of saying and its speaker before the colon are the
  reporting clause (`Spiega il popolare Sanza: "..."`, `tr_colon_left/4`), and
  a quotation that closes at the first comma with only a reporting clause
  after it divides before it is read whole; a phrase that is not `of`, after a
  participle with no adjunct of its own, is the participle's (`Il Comunicato
  diramato dopo quasi tre ore`, `tr_participle_adjunct/4`); a verb of several
  words is shaped by its first (`gives credence to` for `accredita`,
  `tr_phrasal_shaped/1`); the word for `all` before the shape of a phrase has
  its shape (`Tutti gli altri hanno perplessità`, `tr_subject_shape/4`);
  `anche`, `persino` and `solo` before the subject are said of it (`Anche
  Gianni Letta ha parlato` is `También Gianni Letta ...`, where it was `... ha
  hablado también`), English keeping `even` in front and writing `also` with
  the verb, never `Also the dog sleeps` (`en_subject_adverb/4`: the controls
  found six such sentences); never a word that is a preposition too
  (`tr_focus_front/1`: `hasta` is `until` before it is `even`, and `Hasta
  entonces el perro duerme`, the radio section's guard, was red in the whole
  case only -- the adverb `entonces` lifted out of the words left `hasta el
  perro` to read as `even the dog`, which no section of the new report could
  see; its arm is that guard); a cleft whose infinitive is in the perfect (`è
  il solo Segni ad aver sposato questa opzione`), `solo` before the name of a
  cleft (`tr_cleft_who/4`), an article before a perfect infinitive (`l'aver
  ceduto`); a verb of beginning with an infinitive after it takes `has` for
  its perfect (`ha iniziato a raccogliere`, `tr_beginning_verb/1` in the
  writer: the lesson's `"è" is the auxiliary of "inizia".`, which `È iniziato
  il vertice` needs, had made it `è iniziato a raccogliere`, carrefour 7);
  `più` in a denied clause is English `anymore`, written last (`Non ci sarà
  più spazio per i bluff`, `Non la ricorda più nessuno`); `si fa` before an
  adjective is English `becomes`; and `solo che` is `only that`.
  It needed these WORDS in `extra/` (the two readers: a line moves the reader
  of one language and the writer of the other; where a word must stay the one
  written, the dictionary's own line is said again first -- Italian `emette`,
  `teme`, `distinzione`, `ritorna`, `amministra`, `unisce`, `riflette`,
  `episodio`, `ammonimento`, `convenzionale` and `superficiale`, Spanish
  `linterna`): `dirama` (issues, and its participles), `paventa` (fears),
  `distinguo`, `vertice` (a summit, not the peak), `rimette` (gives back),
  `bacchettata`, `puntata`, `stavolta`, `decina`, `oppure`, `eppure`, `melina`
  (stalling), `bluff` (a poker bluff; Spanish `farol`), `leghista` and `par
  condicio` (kept as they are), `dita` (the feminine plural of `dito`),
  `accredita` (gives credence to), `risente di` (reflects), `scosta` and
  `apparta` (moves aside), `aggrega` (joins), `affatto`, `va in scena` (takes
  place), the adverbs, prepositions and adjectives of several words (`l'altro
  ieri`, `subito dopo`, `ogni giorno`, `per strada`, `da una parte`, `da
  l'altra parte`, `attorno a`, `in atto`, `di destra`, `di maniera`, `a doppio
  turno`; Spanish `anteayer`, `justo después de`, `por el camino`, `por la
  otra parte`, `alrededor de`, `en absoluto`, `en curso`, `de derechas`, `a
  doble vuelta`), `cristiano democratico` and `cristianodemócrata`, `centro
  destra` and `centroderecha`, `solo che` and `sólo que`, the auxiliaries of
  `inizia` and `comincia` (the copula), `o` and `ad` that begin a choice and a
  cleft, `popolare` a title, and the names `Fini`, `Polo`, `Olivo`, `Massimo`,
  `Letta`, `Segni`, `Bianco` and `Casini`; and in the two dictionaries' extras
  `matchstick` (`fiammifero` first both ways, `cerino` read only, `cerilla`
  left to right only), `short`/`corto` and `issue`/`questione` (both ways),
  `burn`/`scottare`, `forcing`, `promulgate`/`varare`, `presidentialism`,
  `attainment`, `sensation`, `stalling`/`dilación`, and the adjectives
  `punitive`, `unconstitutional`, `laborious`, `distrustful`, `constituent`
  and `Berlusconian`.
  The CONTROLS (cocolog 1.15.0, store KB107, 93 count files, 2 198 sentences):
  the last version's translator against this one, 21 sentences in 20 files
  outside the three newest reports (this one, the Makula interview and the
  Hotel Arts) read differently (carrefour 7, cecchi 7, eco 21 and 26, fregene
  10, giglio 6, livata 8, lotr 11, montanelli 20 and 28, salvini 9, senegal 1
  and 6, tat 4, twelve 9, valencia 3: the focus adverb before the subject,
  `D'Aquino`, `ha iniziato`, `scosta`, `anymore`, `become`, `give credence
  to`, one that failed and reads), all better -- and the inferences fall 5.148
  % (4 484 481 501 to 4 253 601 294), 0.278 % outside those three (3 221 894
  127 to 3 212 933 629), and 43.0 % in the Hotel Arts report's two files,
  whose tenth sentence is refused after 46.6 million inferences where it took
  120.0 (not looked for); the file that rises most is solana's, +2.5 % of 15
  million. Bytes and characters read every sentence alike (0 differ, the
  characters 0.021 % fewer). The binaries of 1.13.7 and 1.15.0 give the same
  texts and the same inference counts to the unit on both translators
  (1.14.0's shifts and 1.15.0's clock and error names changed nothing the
  translator counts). The DATA COLUMN (the last version's translator on its
  own store, KB93, against this one on the new): 32 sentences in 21 files
  outside those three, each a word of the report's lines or a shape of its
  code -- the focus adverb before the subject (8: eco 26, fregene 10, giglio
  6, montanelli 20, salvini 9, senegal 1, valencia 3 and the English of
  valencia 3), `subito dopo` (4: eco 6 and twelve 8, in both languages), and
  by twos `vertice` (cecchi 21: `cumbres`), `da l'altra parte` (eco 19),
  `D'Aquino` (eco 21), `scosta` (lotr 11), `give credence to` (twelve 9) and
  the place of `certainly` (livata 8), and one each `Marco Polo` (astro 4),
  `anymore` (montanelli 28), `become` (senegal 6), `el asunto` for the issue
  (eco 15), `en torno` (fregene 19), `Move aside` (tat 4), `por` for `per
  strada` (livata 15) and a comma (cecchi 7). THE STATED COST: eco 6, `Salvo
  che subito dopo i due dialoganti hanno osservato che erano state perdute
  ...`, was `los dos dialogantes han observado inmediatamente después que` and
  is `han observado justo después de los dos dialogantes que` (English `have
  observed right after the two dialoguing ones that`): `subito dopo` is the
  adverb there, and the line that makes it a preposition, which `subito dopo
  la fine del vertice` needs, takes the two interlocutors for its object and
  leaves the verb a subject nobody names; the sentence costs 1.08 million
  inferences and now 1.31.
  Written, found to move no sentence of the controls and no check, and taken
  out (each hunk reversed over the full controls): the `fo_np_number`
  alternative, a heading of a choice in `tr_verbless0`, `tr_skip_adverbs`, a
  first-person guard in `tr_conjunction_split`, an English writer clause for
  the connector `cmid/1`, `tr_time_adverb_comp/1` and a split of a quotation's
  number; a fix for English `"X", dice Y, "verb ..."` (refused) went the same
  way, no sentence reaches it. **A clause added to `tr_read0` costs about five
  inferences a call before its first test fails**, so the first cut of the
  shapes cost +0.54 % outside the new reports; what paid was a memo for
  `tr_focus_adverb/1`, the selective test first in `tr_complements0/4` (the
  article before a perfect infinitive) and the question words of
  `tr_adj_word/2` folded into the test they were added to. The report LEAVES:
  sentence 20 (the communiqué's second quotation, `"al tavolo non può trovare
  spazio", prosegue il comunicato, "l'individuazione della maggioranza ... e
  men che meno la durata del medesimo, essendo compito esclusivo del
  parlamento, ..., fornire al capo dello stato tutti gli elementi ..."`),
  which runs to the limit of 300 million inferences in both languages, as it
  did at the start (22 s); and English refuses 17, 31 and 39, the third person
  nobody names, on purpose. Of the 39 it reads into Spanish, what is not
  right: a predicate after a heading takes the heading's gender (`Melina tra
  Polo e Olivo e il voto è più vicino` is `Dilación ... el voto es más
  cercana`); `a Montecitorio` and `al tavolo` keep their `a` (`en`), `sul
  conflitto` is `en el conflicto` (`sobre`) and `varare in parlamento sugli
  stessi argomenti norme punitive` is `promulgar en parlamento en los mismos
  normas argumentos punitivos`; `sia andato in scena un classico` is `ha
  tenido lugar a un clásico` (the subject after the verb has an `a`); `quando
  ... torneranno` keeps the future (`cuando ... regresarán`, where Spanish
  wants the subjunctive) and `convinto che` is `convencido que` (`de que`);
  the time adverbs stand last (`l'altro ieri` in 12, `ieri` in 13, `Ora` in
  36); `non lasciano ben sperare` crosses word by word; sentence 16's list of
  names loses its order (`dei cristiano democratici Casini, Mastella,
  D'Onofrio e del popolare Sanza` is `de los cristianodemócratas Casini para
  simplicidad, a Mastella, D'Onofrio y Sanza`, with `del popolare` left behind
  as `del poblar`, the verb, and English `Casino`), `sposare` is `casar` and a
  quotation inside a quotation leaves a stray mark; `da una parte ...
  dall'altra` is `por la otra por una parte`; `un alleato come segni` is `como
  signos` (a name written small); `senza par condicio niente elezioni` is `sin
  par condicio nada elecciones`; `parla invece di Mario` is `habla en vez de
  Mario` (`invece di` the preposition, the verb being `parla di`); `Hasta mi
  mamá lo sabe` stays `My mum knows him even` (`tr_focus_front/1` leaves out a
  word that is a preposition too; to have both, `tr_adverbs_off/4` would keep
  a preposition's adverb, where it lifts `entonces` out of `hasta entonces`
  and leaves `hasta` bare). English: `spazio` is `blank` (`no blank for the
  poker bluffs anymore`), `incontrarsi` is `find` (`return to find tuesday`),
  `elezioni` were `choices` (settled by the Tatarella interview below), a
  relative clause with no subject of its own
  writes `they` (`an interview in which they clarified`) and `a quell'ora`
  stands last (`to that hour`).
  The PSOE and PNV report (AnCora CESS-CAST-P-20000903-30, 21 sentences,
  Spanish into Italian and English: 21 of 21 and 18 of 21 on a fresh store, 17
  and 14 with the new store alone, 8 and 7 before; reasoning 1.0.3). It needed
  these SHAPES, each with its arm red (test/translate.pl's `newspaper_psoe`: 38
  checks, 21 arms): a pronoun joined to the infinitive after the word for
  `upon` (`al reclamarle que mantenga ...`: the clause is `upon(cl(L, Cls),
  Cs)`, and `tr_cross_comp/2` and both writers know it -- Italian puts the
  pronoun on the gerund, `chiedendogli`, English after it, `on demanding him`;
  four arms, the reader, the cross and each writer) and an `upon` clause that
  reads to no comma is read whole (`fue más lejos al precisar que esa actitud,
  "que no tuvo el PP en su día", es la que ...`: the first comma is the
  apposition's, `tr_upon_rest/5`); a verb of saying takes a person and then a
  clause whether or not the lesson says it takes the clause (`replicó a
  Ibarretxe que ...`: `tr_person_words/3` asks `tr_saying_verb/1`), `retorts`,
  `demands`, `asks`, `requests` and `urges` being verbs of saying to English
  (`en_saying/1`, which the Spanish reader asks as well); the clause after a
  person may open on a pronoun of its verb, on a conjunction of its own or on
  a phrase set in front of its subject (`avisó a Ibarretxe de que a su Gobierno
  el tiempo se le acaba`, `tr_clause_after_person/1`); English `bets on` and
  `distances from` (`en_governs/2`); an insertion with an adjective phrase and
  no verb (`Zapatero, aunque fiel a su consigna de no arremeter contra el PP,
  sí se permitió ...`, the fragment a headline is) and what stands between its
  closing comma and the verb, adverbs, which become the clause's complements,
  and pronouns, which stay with the subject's side (`tr_insertion_off/4`,
  `tr_insertion_tail/3`); `fue` is the preterite of `ser`, not of `ir`, when
  nothing goes (`fue una equivocación`, `ayer fue ...`: `tr_ser_not_ir/4`,
  asked in the clause that takes its subject after the verb and in the
  fronted inversion; with a place or a phrase of `to` after the traveller it
  is the verb that goes); the word for `that` after a verb of saying is no
  `than` (`fue más lejos al precisar que esa actitud ...`:
  `tr_compared_before/2` takes the `que` it is asked about by the words that
  follow it and not the first of the piece, looks back no further than the
  `que` before it, and asks `tr_that_follows_saying/2` -- three arms, and the
  one for the place is a relative `que` and then a real comparison, `La casa
  que duerme es más grande que el perro`, which the controls broke in two
  sentences without it, mobile 7 and salvini 28); a copula reports nothing
  (`La casa, que compró Pedro, es la mejor` has no comment at its end,
  `tr_reporting/3`: football 10 falls 42 % and cecchi 24 2 % for it, the
  clause of who said so no longer read for a copula); a verb among the words
  before a phrase set in front of the pronoun that takes it up again makes
  them a clause of their own (`Dijo que el perro lo come`, which the cut after
  the dislocation's condition refused, `tr_read_statement0/4`; the cost
  below); and the tonic `sí`, which the lesson says never precedes the verb,
  is an adverb before it (`Pedro sí duerme`, `tr_clitic/2`).
  It needed these WORDS in `extra/` (the dictionary's own word said again first
  where it must stay the one written: Spanish `acuerda`, Italian `chiede` asks
  before it demands): Italian `discorso` (a speech, not an address), `al
  momento di`, `chiude la porta`, `come si evince da`, `chiede` (demands, and
  takes the clause), `concorda` (before the dictionary's `accorda`), `auspica
  di`, `punta` (bets, `su`), `distanzia` (`da`), `critica velata`, and in
  eng-ita.dix `distanziare`, `antiterrorista`, `schizzinoso`, `tessere`,
  `disposto`, `potenziare`, `sabotare` for torpedo, `errore`, `sottolineare` and
  `confronto` (written only); Spanish `a la hora de`, `avisa` (the clause and
  `de`), `velada crítica`, `conviene` (suits, and the clausal agrees with
  `en`), `según se desprende de`, `da portazo`, `aboga` (`por`), `apuesta`
  (`por`), `distancia` (`de`), `confrontación`, the name `Mayor Oreja`, and in
  eng-spa.dix `distanciar`, `antiterrorista`, `remilgado`, `torpedear`, `tejer`
  and, read only, `arremeter`, `tremendismo`, `recomponer`, `espetar`, `senda`,
  `crispación`, `consigna`, `precisar` (specifies), `trasladar` (conveys) and
  `potenciar`. The first word moved in 7 Italian and 4 Spanish meanings
  (speech, agrees, bets, boosts, demands, distances and weaves in Italian;
  boosts, conveys, rebuilds and weaves in Spanish), and the first meaning of
  5 Spanish words and 1 Italian word moved too (`confrontación`, `potencia`,
  `precisa`, `teje`, `traslada`; `tesse`).
  The CONTROLS (cocolog 2.0.0, store KB116, 95 count files, 2 240 sentences:
  every earlier article, Tatoeba's 400 and the new report, both directions):
  the last version's translator against this one, on the one store, 4
  sentences in 2 files read differently (clot 14 in English, `bets on` for
  `bets for`; tat 69, 222 and 278, `fue` as was and not went: `Tom was`, `It was
  your idea`), all better -- and the inferences fall 1.273 % (4 574 388 857 to
  4 516 160 393), 0.0007 % outside the new report (4 253 642 195 to 4 253 610
  973, the Hotel Arts report in), that report's two files rising 0.012 %. The
  file that rises most is senegal's, +1.5 % of 123 million (its second
  sentence, below), and the one that falls most football's, -1.2 % (its tenth,
  a copula that reported). Bytes and characters read every sentence alike (0
  differ, the bytes 0.021 % more). The DATA COLUMN (the last version's
  translator on its own store, KB107, against this one on the new): 14
  sentences in 6 files, each a word of the report's lines: `reclamar` is
  `chiedere` (abogacia 1, basque 3, carrefour 4, 5, 6, 14 and 20, clot 20,
  football 13: `reclamò` is `chiese`, and the clause after it is in the
  subjunctive now, `chiese che il Tribunale ... intervenga`), `scommette per`
  is `punta su` (clot 14, and English `bets on`), and the three of `fue` above.
  THE STATED COSTS: `precisar` is `specifies` before it is `requires` and
  `trasladar` `conveys` before it is `moves` -- the dictionary's lines marked
  for reading come first, and the article needs both (`al precisar que`,
  `trasladará al lehendakari la posición del PSOE`) -- so `La empresa precisa
  más tiempo` is `L'impresa specifica più tempo` and a man `trasladado` to a
  hospital is conveyed: no sentence of the controls has either, and a lead;
  and the dislocation's own cost, FOUND BY TAKING EACH RULE OUT (the fourteen
  heaviest sentences counted over a copy of the library per rule, two seconds a
  copy): the first cut, the cut moved after the subject read, cost +21.1 million
  inferences outside the new report and the Hotel Arts one (+0.52 %), all of it
  in four sentences (eco 15, 22 and 25, senegal 2). When the words before the phrase read as no
  subject the clause failed with the condition's choices kept, and the long
  front was parsed again at every other determiner (eco 25: 2.8 million), and
  the clauses after it were asked of sentences none of them reads (eco 22,
  `Che poi queste cose le sapessero i dotti ...`, whose `che poi` has no verb:
  2.5 million). The first front is taken once now (`once/1`, as the cut did),
  and the cut stays unless a verb stands among the words before the phrase.
  What is left is eco 15 and senegal 2, 1.7 million inferences each (a 42 % and
  a 7 % rise of the sentence), where the words hold a verb and read as no
  subject and the clauses after the dislocation are asked and read neither.
  Written and taken out: a test that the words before the phrase end on `que`
  after a clause (free of cost, and it fixed `Dijo que el perro lo come`, but
  sentence 20's words end on `a`: `avisó a Ibarretxe de que a su Gobierno ...`);
  the pronoun's agreement asked before the subject (the cost did not move); and
  the soft failure for any unreadable subject (+0.14 %, eco 22's `che poi`). **An arm
  that makes the section RAISE is red with no FAIL line** (the English writer's
  clause for `upon(cl(...))` taken out: a `type_error` out of reason_translate/4
  ends the section) -- the arm driver counts `ERROR` lines and reads the last
  line, `GREEN` or `RED`. The report LEAVES, of the 21 into Italian:
  `partido` is the match before it is the party (`tutte le partite democratiche`,
  `la sua partita`); the quotation `se "digan las cosas claras"` loses its
  opening mark (8); in 5, `di non d'assalire contro il PP` (a second `di`,
  elided, before the infinitive), `si permise fare` (no `di` before the
  infinitive of `permitirse`) and the comma after the insertion lost;
  `avvertì a Ibarretxe` (Italian says `avvertì Ibarretxe`) and English `warned
  to`; `de haber sido votado` is `d'avere stato votato` (the perfect passive
  infinitive); `dispuestos a buscar` is `avuti a cercare` (the participle of
  `dispone`, which has); `fue más lejos` is `fu più lontano` (went further:
  the copula); `sí` is written last (`non contribuisce ... sì`); `se le acaba`
  is `si gli finisce` (the idiom is `gli si sta esaurendo`); `digan` and
  `gobierne` in a clause of `que` are written in the indicative; `unidad de fondo
  sólidamente arraigada` keeps its Spanish between marks; `senda` is `traiettoria`
  and English writes `cuidadoso` as `accurate` (12: `showed very accurate`),
  `aboga` as `advocate` (2: `Advocate to weave a solid unit and of fund`) and
  `warned to Ibarretxe` (20); English refuses 5, 11 and 13 for the third person
  nobody names, on purpose (`aunque ... sí se permitió ... al reclamarle que
  mantenga`; `espetó al presidente que es la hora de que "gobierne"`; `Anunció
  que trasladará al lehendakari ... pero evitó`).
  The Tatarella interview (VIT-9714..9749, 36 sentences, Italian into Spanish
  and English: 36 of 36 and 36 of 36 on a fresh store, 25 and 25 with the new
  store alone, 16 and 16 before; reasoning 1.0.4). It needed these
  SHAPES, each with its arm red (test/translate.pl's `newspaper_tatarella`: 34
  checks, 19 arms and 5 guards, each guard red when its rule is made too wide): a
  pronoun and a phrase of `of` for a subject (`qualcuno di voi sta giocando con
  carte truccate`: `qualcuno` is a pronoun and no determiner, as `nessuno`,
  `uno` and `alcuni` are, and the subject shape wanted a noun, a name or a
  determiner, `tr_subject_shape/4`'s last alternative); THE PLURAL OF `YOU`,
  which the IR never had outside a subject (`Hablo de tú`, `te acusa`, `ninguno
  de tú`, the lead of the Abogacía report): a word of the IR where it is no
  subject, `you all`, made by `tr_pronoun_across/6` for a pronoun the lesson
  says is the plural of one that means `you` (`tr_plural_you/1`: `"voi" is the
  plural of "tu"`, `"vi" is the plural of "ti"`, Spanish `vosotros` and `os`, in
  corpus/extra), written `you` by English and as the plural of the pronoun the
  role takes by the lesson's language (`voi`, `vi`), the reflexive of a plural
  subject (`voi vi lavate`, `tr_personal_object/3`) and the plural subject
  itself (`voi direte elezioni`, `tr_subject_pronoun/4`) following it -- six
  arms; a question is no command (`Sembra poco?` has the spelling of an
  imperative, whose clause took the sentence and, its cut kept every other
  reading from it, left the question refused, `tr_read/4`); a clause of `that`
  and nothing else is a fragment (`che è stato un incidente di percorso`, the
  line after `diciamo che ...`, `tr_that_fragment/4`: asked for the WHOLE piece
  after every other reading, because as a clause of `tr_read0/4` it took the
  first half of eco's `Che poi il cane dorma, guardate che ...` apart and the
  whole case found it) and one left open (`diciamo che ...`, `that_open/0`); a
  name before a colon is a heading (`Tatarella: i trucchi sono vietati`,
  `tr_heading_left/3`); a participle and an infinitive with no subject are said
  of the infinitive (`con un patto: vietato truccare` took the gender of the
  table before the colon, `prohibida amañar`, `tr_gap_comps_out/3`); an article
  and a possessive before a noun that is a participle too are no reduced
  relative (`la loro proposta` was `el ellos propuesta`, `tr_np/3`: asked after
  the participle test, before it +0.8 % of the heaviest sentences); which with
  a verb of the first or the second person asks for its object (`Quale libro
  leggi?`, `fo_question_word/3`); a word the lesson gives `what` asks with the
  phrase after it as `quale` does (`e che colpa ha se la loro proposta è
  interpretata ...?` is which fault; `tr_which_asks/2`), with a NOUN OR AN
  ADJECTIVE at the head of the phrase and no determiner -- `cosa le posso dire?`
  has `le` for the clause's own, and the first cut, any phrase word, refused
  sentence 3 of the article and no sentence of the 18 probed with `cosa` showed
  it (the re-run of the article did; the guard is `cosa il cane vede?`); two
  questions with a comma between them (`e perché mai, e chi lo dice?`,
  `tr_question_half/2`); a question with no mark, a comma and a statement
  (`cosa le posso dire, sarà stato un equivoco`: the question half is marked
  `qh/1`, and the join writes it as a question -- the first cut wrote any join
  whose first clause asked for something so, and Cecchi's `che, dicono a Raidue,
  è raggiante` became `what do they say`, the one text the controls found);
  `se e in che modo` opens an indirect question (`tr_indirect_word/3`); and THE
  FORM OF A COMMAND, which Italian's second person plural of the present
  indicative is (`aprite`, `guardate che ...`, `non pensate che ...`) and
  Spanish's present subjunctive its negative one (`no miréis`): the builder
  states a person for every tense of the second person plural now (Italian 9 798
  lines of `is the second person of` to 17 998, Spanish 14 775 to 27 435)
  except a form the language commands with (`cb_command_plural/3`), because
  stated a person too those five commands of the controls became `abrís`,
  `miráis` and `sois`, and the participle's feminine plural (`proibite`,
  `studiate`, `annegate`: the same spelling) made three headlines clauses --
  they are the statement only where the sentence says so: a plural `you` named
  at the head (`e voi rispondete col presidenzialismo`, whose group is the plural
  form's with the second person the pronoun gives it) or a form of `stare` with
  a gerund after it (`state proseguendo nel cosiddetto gioco del cerino`,
  `state attenti` stays the command), `tr_read_statement0/4`.
  It needed these WORDS in `extra/` (the dictionary's own word said again first
  where it must stay the one written: Italian `deputato` and `deputata` for the
  deputy `onorevole` is read as, `ipocrita` for the hypocrite `doppiogiochista`
  is read as, and the identity `"con il" is the contraction of "con il"` before
  `"col" is the contraction of "con il"`, so that `col` is read and the print
  writes `con il`): Italian `malafede`, `incidente di percorso`, `bacchetta`
  (rebukes), `aspetta al varco`, `dal momento che`, `perché mai`, `il giorno in
  cui`, `in che modo`, `se e in che modo`, `a tutela di`, `elezione` (an
  election first, the dictionary's choice second), `per l'ultima volta`, `voi`
  and `vi` (the plurals of `tu` and `ti`), and in eng-ita.dix `rig`, `intend`
  (read only), `trace`, `resign` (`dimettere`: the bilingual dictionary's
  `dimettire` is no word, and its thirty-six lines of forms are gone from the
  vocabulary), `bloc`, `hypocrite` and `deputy` (read only); Spanish `mala fe`,
  `vosotros` and `os`, `acecha` (lies in wait for, before threatens), `si y
  cómo`, `de forma realista`, `para la protección de`, `por última vez`, and in
  eng-spa.dix `rig` (`amañar`) and `hypocrite`. The first word moved in 2
  Italian meanings and 1 Spanish one (bloc is `schieramento` and no `bloc`,
  traces `traccia` and no `localizza`, rigs `amaña` and no `apareja`), the first
  meaning of 3 words moved (`elezione` is an election, `acecha` lies in wait,
  `amaña` rigs and no longer alters: that line is lost, as is Italian
  `localizza` = traces) and `hypocrite` moved too until `ipocrita` was said
  again: the read-only line for the word the text had was written first.
  The CONTROLS (cocolog 2.1.2, store KB126, 97 count files, 2 312 sentences:
  every earlier article, Tatoeba's 400 and the interview, both directions): the
  last version's translator against this one, on the one store, 31 sentences in
  5 files read differently -- 28 in the interview's two files, and 3 elsewhere
  (eco 16, `no creerte` is `no creeros`; fregene 30, `hablar con tú` is `con
  vosotros`; tat 346, refused before and `That Dios pays it to him` now), all
  better -- and the inferences fall 0.267 % (4 589 831 928 to 4 577 556 536),
  0.038 % more outside the interview (4 516 197 717 to 4 517 921 885, the Hotel
  Arts report in). The files rise 0.44 % at most (pacifist's, of 5 million; lotr's
  0.43 % of 71) and the one that falls most is eco's, -1.8 % (its twenty-third,
  5.3 million to 2.7: a question that was read as a command first). Cecchi 25,
  the one text the first cut changed (`what do they say`), reads as it did.
  Bytes and characters read every sentence alike (0 differ, the bytes 0.021 %
  more). The DATA COLUMN (the last version's translator on its own store, KB116,
  against this one on the new): 52 sentences in 8 files, 43 of them the
  interview's and 9 elsewhere -- `elezioni` are `elections` where the dictionary
  gave `choices` first (bovalino 12 and 14, tempi 38 and 40, wapo 3: English),
  the three of the code above, and tat 192 (`¿Por qué estáis enfadadas?`, `Why
  are you angered?`), which the store alone reads now: `estáis` is a person it
  states. The inferences fall 1.946 % (4 668 389 400 to 4 577 556 536), rise
  0.039 % outside the interview (4 516 160 393 to 4 517 921 885), and the
  interview's two files fall 61 % (76 million to 30 each) for the 40 sentences
  that refused after long searches. THE STORE ALONE COSTS NOTHING outside the
  interview (the last version's translator on the old store and on the new: 4 516
  160 393 to 4 516 197 717, +0.0008 %), though it states 8 200 lines of the
  second person plural more in Italian and 12 660 in Spanish, and that
  translator reads 25 and 25 of the interview's 36 on it. **A FIRST STORE WAS
  11.2 % DEARER FOR ONE LINE**: `The word "che" means "which".`, which first
  made `e che colpa abbiamo se ...` read, cost the last version's translator
  alone 4 978 433 218 inferences over the 95 files against 4 475 127 352, the
  six heaviest sentences 2.6 times (cecchi 8, with two `che`, 49.3 to 192.2
  million; cecchi 9, tempi 17, eco 8 and 22, letter 8 the others), found by
  teaching a store without each group of the new lines -- the second person
  lines, the phrases, the verbs and nouns, the plurals of `you`: nothing; this
  line: all of it -- and the line went out of the data and into the code
  (`tr_which_asks/2`, above). The binaries of 2.0.0 and 2.1.0 give the same
  counts to 48 inferences in 4.32 billion, and one text differs (fiat 6); those
  of 2.1.0 and 2.1.2 give the same counts and texts to the unit, on both
  translators and both stores (master moved to 2.1.2 while the controls ran, and
  they were taken again on it).
  THE STATED COSTS: `col` is read, and written `con il` (the writer takes the
  first contraction a lesson states, and the identity line first makes `col`
  read only; the seven sentences of the controls, Spanish into Italian, that
  came out `col` came back); a command stays a command -- `Siate`, `processate`, `guardate che ...`,
  `non pensate che ...`, `No miréis`, `State attenti`, which reads as the
  participle of `essere` as before -- and is a statement only after a plural
  `you` or as `stare` with a gerund; and the inferences, +0.038 % outside the
  interview. THE COST OF THE CODE, FOUND BY TAKING EACH RULE OUT (the sixteen
  heaviest sentences counted over a copy of the library per rule, on the new
  store): the first cut was +0.457 % of them over the last version's, and four
  rules were all of it -- the plural of `you` asked of every pronoun that is a
  subject (0.227 %), the two clauses of the command, each reading the piece's
  denial again (0.18 %), `that_open` (0.034 %, a lone `che` at the end of a piece
  read as other things first) and the possessive guard (0.009 %). The plural of
  `you` is asked of a pronoun that means `you` now (`E == you` before
  `tr_plural_you/1`), and the two commands are one clause with the form of the
  command asked first, before the pronoun's lexeme: +0.163 % of the sixteen, 0.096
  of it the clause's own reading of the denial (`tr_negation/4` walks the whole
  piece, in every clause of `tr_read_statement0/4`), and every text of the 2 312
  the same as the first cut's. Its cost outside the interview is a few
  sentences: e_eco 16 (+0.87 million of 6.5, a sentence English refuses, and the
  search that refuses is longer), lotr 11 (+0.25 of 31.7) and cecchi 8 (+0.18 of
  49.3), against eco 23's 2.65 million.
  The interview LEAVES, of the 36 into Spanish (English alike unless it says):
  `vi accusa di fare` is `os acusa hacer` and `accuses you to make` (7), and
  `nell'attesa di vedere` `en la espera ver` (11) -- after a pronoun or a phrase
  the infinitive loses its `di`, and nothing in a lesson says which verbs take
  one; `passa di mano` is `happens of hand` and `chi provoca` `al que provoca`
  (11); `ci siamo basati` is `nos hemos basado` (10), `ci siamo intesi` `nos
  hemos pretendido` and `il potere` `la fortaleza` (21, and `poteri forti` are
  `fortalezas fuertes`, 18), `il valore` is `la valentía` (24: `dandogli` is
  `dandole`, `pare proprio di no` `me parece justamente de no`), `registro` is
  `récord` and `buoni` `cupones` (13), `il confronto` `la comparación` (31),
  `fare i nomi` `hacer los nombres` (17); `Null'altro` is `Nada otros` and
  `nothing others` (25); `ci ha mai creduto` is `nos ha creído nunca` (27: the
  `ci` that stands for `in it`), and Spanish writes `sulle riforme` as `en las
  reformas` (English has `on`); `siamo disposti a` is `somos colocados a` (28), `crediamo al`
  `creemos al` (no `en el`) and `mettiamola` `Pongamosla` (no accent); `non hanno
  capito ancora cosa` keeps `cosa` as a noun at the end of its clause
  (`han entendido todavía cosa`, 29: the question word of an indirect question
  with nothing after it, unread) and `vogliono altro` is `quieren otros`;
  `se fossi in malafede` is `si estaba en mala fe` and `If I was` (12: the
  imperfect subjunctive is written as an indicative, as in the PSOE report),
  `Il giorno in cui Dini si dimetterà` `Cuando Dini se dimitirá` and `When Dini
  will resign` (33: Spanish wants the subjunctive after `cuando`, English the
  present); a passive `si` before the verb is lost in English (`il voto non si
  decide` is `the vote does not decide`, 32; `Le mele si mangiano` `The apples
  eat`; `Si possono fare le cose` `The things are caned make`; `che
  realisticamente si possono fare` `that realistically can make`, 15); English
  writes the clitic of a question as a thing (`what can I say her`, `who says
  him`, 3 and 6); Italian `te` is no word of the lesson (`Parlo di te` is refused,
  `Te lo dico io` is `I say it to You I`: the dictionary gives `ti` only);
  `state attenti` and `state grandi` read as the participle of `essere`, as
  before (`Cuidadosos han sido sido`); `acecharemos el Pds` has no `al`.

## Tutorials are documentation that runs

`tutorials/` holds 130 files -- `basics/` 13, `library/` 52, `opencv/` 23,
`tensor/` 42 -- and `test/tutorials.pl` runs them all (300 s a lesson, 600 s
for opencv, 900 s for `library/45-tagger`). **Every claim is a `must/3`**,
repeated at the bottom of each file so a lesson can be copied anywhere; a
lesson that stops being true FAILS, naming both answers. **A lesson's last
line is exactly `done`.** Lesson 46's `main/0` once grew past a page
(cocolint Z1): move sections into predicates of their own.

## macOS

The whole family builds on a Mac; each of these fails naming something other
than its cause:

* **Shared objects and test binaries leave interpreter symbols undefined**:
  `tools/cc` adds `-Wl,-undefined,dynamic_lookup` to every Darwin link, and
  `COCO_WEAK`/`CE_WEAK` are `weak_import`.
* **There is no `/proc/self/exe`**: `lb_exedir` asks `_NSGetExecutablePath`;
  programs read `current_prolog_flag(executable, P)`.
* **`make schema` dies in libc++** (`binary_function` removed): copy the home
  config, add `-D_LIBCPP_ENABLE_CXX17_REMOVED_BINARY_FUNCTION` to
  `CPP_FLAGS`, run `ZIGURATIP_CONF=that-file make schema`.
* **A raylib photograph is one frame behind**: draw a frame twice before a
  screenshot or a pixel read. **A sleeping screen opens no window**
  (`GLFW: Failed to determine Monitor`); `test/ray.pl` probes and SKIPs;
  `caffeinate -u` wakes it.
* **XQuartz ships XTEST off**: `defaults write org.x.X11
  enable_test_extensions -boolean true`, restart X11.
* **Ask `library(os)`, not a shell** (`os_is/1`, `os_has/1`,
  `os_lib_path_var/1`, `os_tmp/1`, `os_cpus/1`). No `setsid`, BSD `date`
  has no `%N`, BSD `wc` pads, BSD `sed` ignores `\|`.
* A server's READY line comes ~1.4 s before its port opens, and a page that
  warms a store is ~4x slower than on the Linux box.
