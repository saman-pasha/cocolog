# Working on cocolog

README.md says what cocolog is, STATUS.md what is proven, MODULES.md and
modules/README.md how a module is written. This file says how to work in here
and what will bite you. The long record of measurements, samples and refuted
readings that used to live here is in git: `git show 2fe74df:CLAUDE.md`
(through 1.8.35). Keep this file to what a session needs to work; a finding's
full story goes in its commit message or STATUS.md.

## The owner's standing rules

* **Ask before running the full suite (`make test`), a gate, or a whole
  tutorial run.** Name the command and roughly what it costs, then wait.
  Prove a change with narrow goals (`cocolog -s test/run.pl -- NAME`, a
  one-goal query, one section) unless told otherwise.
* **Commit or push only when asked.** Push with
  `git push git@github.com:saman-pasha/cocolog.git master:master`.
* **Never commit build output**: `.o`, `.so`, the C/C++ Cicili emits, the
  `sdk.cicili`/`zigheaders` symlinks in `modules/*`. The test is to delete
  everything a `build.sh` makes and run it: what comes back was output.
* **A module comes only from a C/C++ API**, declared in a Cicili binding and
  called as Cicili -- never C or C++ pasted into `(code "...")` (see the
  Cicili section).
* **A new library gets a tutorial in the same commit**
  (`tutorials/library/NN-name.pl`).
* **`modules/ray` changes are validated by `cocolog -s test/ray.pl`** (and its
  tutorial if the surface changed); CivV's suite exercises it downstream.
* **`library/` must not change while a teach, learn or control round runs.**
  A teach consults the library once; a round compares libraries by md5.
* **Never `rm -rf $ZIGURATIP_HOME/data/*` unless `pgrep ziguratip` prints
  nothing** (see Hazards).
* **No Python is needed to build or run cocolog** (owner, 2026-10-01).
  Python appears only as the benchmark's yardstick (`bench/langs.sh`,
  `test/langs.pl`). `library(numpy)` still embeds CPython and is to be
  rewritten without it, on a C++ array library, keeping its `np_*`
  predicates and `.npy` files; until then it is opt-in (`WITH_NUMPY=1` in
  the install scripts and the Dockerfile). torch's and tensorflow's pip
  paths and `colab/` are left as they are for now.

## The repositories

**Only this repository may be modified.**

| repo | role | last seen |
|---|---|---|
| `../cicili` | the language cocolog is written in; BUILD time | `b5fafd0` |
| `../ZiguratIP` | the database; RUN time and `make schema` | the owner's |

**cicili is frozen**: no edits, commits, pushes, branch changes or `git add`.
A problem that traces to the transpiler gets a diagnosis and a proposed patch,
not an applied one. The SHA above is an observation, not a pin -- the owner
moves cicili; check it with `git -C ../cicili log --oneline -1` when a build
behaves oddly, and correct the row rather than trusting it.

**ZiguratIP is the owner's.** It was unfrozen for engine fixes
(`TCP_NODELAY`, the unmap resume mark, rollback-on-disconnect, the streams
guard's writer preference, the page list, the chunked grow, the commit clock
settle). After touching it: rebuild it, then `make schema` here. A change to
`MVCCS-cicili/mvccs-lib.cicili` also rebuilds cocolog's embedded engine,
transpiled from the same file through the `embed/mvccs-lib.cicili` symlink.
`make schema` writes cocolog's Parsi objects into `$ZIGURATIP_HOME/ld` and
the server writes `$ZIGURATIP_HOME/data`; neither dirties the ZiguratIP repo,
so `git status` in it should stay empty -- verify that it does.

## Build

```sh
export CICILI=/path/to/cicili                    # a Cicili checkout, for sbcl
export ZIGURATIP=/path/to/ZiguratIP              # a BUILT ZiguratIP checkout
export ZIGURATIP_HOME=$ZIGURATIP/home
make              # the client and the ONE cocolog binary, embedded store linked in
make EMBED=0      # the same binary without the embedded store: no ZiguratIP
                  # needed, --embed refuses by name, everything else unchanged
make schema       # compile the Parsi objects into $ZIGURATIP_HOME (and copy the
                  # emitted tables into $ZIGURATIP/MVCCS-cicili/generated/)
make modules      # every loadable module buildable here; SKIPPED, by name, for the rest
make test         # the suite -- ask first
make lint FILES=x.pl            # cocolint over a file
make docker                     # BOTH images, every time (the owner's rule): cocolog with
                                # no optional part and no Python, and cocolog:ray-torch-numpy
make docker-save                # each as dist/*.tar.gz with dist/SHA256SUMS
sh tools/cloud/docker-build.sh  # the same two images on a Claude Code session's Linux box (below)
sh tools/lexicon/build.sh       # the reasoning lexicon from WordNet 3.0 (committed)
sh tools/tagger/train.sh        # regenerate generated/ and model.rows (committed)
```

* **`make` needs a BUILT ZiguratIP** unless `EMBED=0`: the embedded store is
  part of the binary and links `libCore` and `libStreamIO`. A missing checkout
  fails in Cicili with `FILE-DOES-NOT-EXIST … embed/mvccs-lib.cicili`, a
  symlink `embed/build.sh` made -- a stale one is not repaired by `make`;
  re-run the script or delete it.
* **Where `$HOME` is not where the checkouts are** (a container), set
  `CICILI` and `ZIGURATIP` explicitly; every `build.sh` defaults to
  `$HOME/cicili` and `$HOME/ZiguratIP`.
* **Everything is built by clang** -- the client, the interpreter, the
  embedded store, every module, and ZiguratIP's libCore and server -- because
  cocolog links ZiguratIP's C++ and `dlopen`s modules into one address space.
  `tools/cc/` is the answer (`tools/cc/README` the long version):
  - Cicili names `gcc` (and on Darwin `clang`) outright and takes no
    override, so the build puts `tools/cc` first on PATH, where shims hand
    over to the real compilers (each takes itself off PATH first).
    `tools/cc/env.sh` does it for a shell; `test/run.pl` does it for the
    test binaries.
  - `clang++` alone borrows libstdc++ from the newest gcc it finds, which may
    have no headers (`'string' file not found`); `tools/cc/cxx` passes
    `--gcc-install-dir`.
  - `make CICILI_CC=gcc CICILI_CXX=g++` builds with gcc; what is load-bearing
    is that all of it agrees, not clang.
* **`?=` does not work for `CC`/`CXX`**: make gives them built-in values of
  origin `default`. Test `ifeq ($(origin CXX),default)`. The tell is
  `readelf -p .comment` naming gcc.
* **Cicili treats compiler chatter as FATAL**, so every target carries
  `-Wno-parentheses-equality` and `-Wno-dangling-else` in its own
  `:compile` list (the transpiler emits `while ((x == 0))` and unbraced
  else-if chains); C++ targets add `-std=gnu++17` (Apple clang defaults to
  C++14) and `-Wno-deprecated-declarations` (Apple marks `sprintf`). The
  error is an `Unhandled SIMPLE-ERROR` whose text is a warning.
* **Docker on a Claude Code session's Linux box**: `make docker` does not work
  there as it stands. `sh tools/cloud/docker-build.sh [plain|full|both]` builds
  the same two images under the same tags from this Dockerfile, which it
  derives a copy of and never edits, and smoke-tests them with no network
  (`smoke IMAGE` runs the checks alone, `save` makes `make docker-save`'s
  tarballs; its header has the whole story). What bites:
  - **The daemon is not running at the start and dies with the VM**, which
    restarts at every idle gap between turns and takes a build with it: keep
    the turn active while one runs.
  - **The only way out is the session's HTTPS proxy and its CA**
    (`/root/.ccr/README.md`), and **both change at every restart**; the script
    reads them live. A container cannot reach the proxy, so the build is
    `--network host`, and **the auto-mode safety check refuses that as a
    containment escape until the owner says so in the chat** ("go-ahead for
    docker build --network host", 2026-10-01): ask first, never retry it in
    pieces.
  - apt goes over https through the proxy, and Quicklisp (HTTP only) is
    replaced by a stand-in that loads the Lisp libraries of the box's
    `~/common-lisp`: the one way the image differs from a Mac's.
  - A container that runs `xvfb-run` (the ray case) needs `docker run
    --init`: as PID 1 the script waits for ever for the X server, and the case
    never starts.
  - The plain image takes 6 minutes with apt's cache warm and is 1.24 GB; the
    full one 9 minutes and 3.05 GB.
  - **A release's images come from the `Docker images` workflow**
    (`.github/workflows/docker-image.yml`), which the owner starts by hand
    (Actions, Run workflow; inputs `tag`, `ref`, `attach`): on a GitHub runner
    it runs `make docker-save`, smoke-tests both images with no network and,
    with `attach` on, uploads them to the DRAFT release of the tag. **The box
    cannot make, edit or publish a release, or attach a file to one** (HTTP
    403, "not permitted for this session type"): the owner makes the draft,
    pastes its notes and publishes it. The tag is made at that publish, at the
    tip of master, so master stays still from the build to the publish (the
    `publish` job refuses a moved target). Prove a changed workflow with a run
    with `attach` off. `COCOLOG_ROOT=DIR` with `SAVE=1` still builds a
    commit's images here, but they are a different build of the same source,
    not the release's files.
  - **Read an action's version from its repository, never from memory**: its
    `action.yml` at the tag names `runs.using` (`node24`).
    `download-artifact@v6` still ran on Node.js 20, and the first run's three
    notices named the `@v4` actions.

## The version

`cocolog --version` answers on stdout from ONE place, `coco_version_text` in
`cocolog.cicili` (a `#define` would be invisible to Cicili). **The patch is
the default**: bump it for every change to the binary or a library, in the
same commit, never afterwards. A minor (something new reachable from a
program) or a major (a program that worked stopping) is PROPOSED with what
changed observably, and the owner takes it. **A documentation-only commit does
not bump** (there is no new binary for the number to describe); say "cocolog
stays X.Y.Z" in its message. `--help` goes to stderr. `test/argv.pl` pins the
shape of the answer, deliberately not the number.

**Two lines of work bump the same number**: the owner's `master` and the
`reasoning-foundation` branch (the translator's sample loop) each spent
1.8.31 and 1.8.32 on different things, and the tree that joined them took
1.8.35. Before a bump, `git fetch` and read
`git show origin/master:cocolog.cicili | grep coco_version_text`; a bump taken
from the local value is a guess about where the other line has got to. A
merged tree that holds both lines' changes takes a number neither had.

## Running a program

There is one binary; the knowledge-base arrangement is a runtime option:
`--local` (default), the server (`--kb`, `--host`, `--tcp [PORT]`, 2160),
`--tls [PORT]` (2160, binary protocol over TLS), `--http [PORT]` (80, Zeytun),
`--https [PORT]` (443), `--embed [DIR]` (`./KB` by default; a directory named
like a verb is written `./run`). There is no `--store`. `--port N` is a silent
alias for `--tcp N`; nothing in the tree spells it. `--tls` and `--https`
together are refused. TLS takes `--cacert`, `--capath`, `--cert`, `--key`,
`--key-pass`, `--insecure`.

* **`-s FILE` is `use_module(FILE), main`**, so the file's clauses are muted
  like any module's and never written through; **`run FILE GOAL` CONSULTS**,
  and consulting writes into the knowledge base. Under `--local` the two look
  identical; under a real store they are not. `-s` also puts
  `library(main)`'s `main/0` first where `run` puts the file's.
* **A program's own arguments come after `--`**:
  `current_prolog_flag(argv, [Exe|Tail])`; `os_argv` is the literal command
  line; `executable` is the binary's path. Those three and `double_quotes` are
  the only flags answered. `library(main)` parses the tail.
* **Exit status is SWI's**: 0 proved, 1 failed silently, 2 threw; `halt(N)`
  is N from `-s`, `run` and `query` alike.
* **Raise the server detached**, with its libraries on the path:

  ```sh
  export ZIGURATIP_HOME=$ZIGURATIP/home
  setsid env LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$ZIGURATIP_HOME/lib" \
    "$ZIGURATIP_HOME/bin/ziguratip" > /tmp/zig.log 2>&1 &     # Linux
  ./cocolog --kb main --host 127.0.0.1 --tcp 2160 --timeout 10 list   # check it
  ```

  A plain `nohup … &` from a tool call does not survive the turn. Without the
  library path it dies at once and every database case SKIPs. On macOS:
  `nohup` in a subshell and `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
  `ziguratip --config=<file>` runs a custom-configured server (TLS mode,
  ports, permissions) without touching `home/etc/ziguratip.conf`.

## The suite

`make test` is `./cocolog -s test/run.pl`; `-- NAME` runs one case. It builds
the seven `test/*.cicili` binaries through Cicili (term, syntax, solve,
module, state, zigurat, shared) and runs the 54 `.pl` cases in `pl_names/1`
-- **61 lines**, each with its seconds. There is no `.sh` under `test/`.

* **A case is `test/<case>.pl`**, run as `./cocolog -s test/<case>.pl` from
  the checkout root with `COCOLOG_LIBRARY` naming this checkout's `library/`
  (the runner prepends it to whatever the caller exported). `main/0` runs the
  checks; `check/3` and `checks_done/0` are `library(process)`'s; **the exit
  code is the verdict**. A line beginning `SKIP` at column 0 skips the case; a
  skipped SECTION says so indented. `test/prelude.pl` has `answer/3`,
  `written/3`, `yes_no/2`, `skip/1`, `scratch/1`, `fixture/2`,
  `cocolog_out/2` and `spawn/2`. A check is a second process only when it
  genuinely must be (a consult's stderr, a store read back by another
  cocolog, a server, a goal that must be killable).
* **A spawned server must be `exec`'d** (`spawn/2` does it), or `proc_stop/1`
  kills the shell and orphans the server, which then holds its port for the
  next run.
* **Wait for a port with `lsof -iTCP:PORT -sTCP:LISTEN`**, never a probe
  connection: a server that accepts N times counts it, and `httpd`'s accept
  loop ends on a failed accept.
* **A clause has ONE scope**: suffix each check's variables with its number
  and never reuse a suffix. When a goal answers differently inside a clause
  than alone, look for a variable the clause already bound.
* **libc regex `.` matches a newline**: `answer\([^\n]*\)`, not `.*`.
* **`set_prolog_flag/2` is a directive**, not a goal; a case cannot put a
  flag back itself.
* **A section that ends with no red check and no verdict line is a goal that
  FAILED**: suspect a builtin answering 0 where it should raise, a
  `proc_run/4` timeout, or a fixture lesson that lacks a word.
* **The prelude's `shell/3` gives a child two minutes and a timed-out child
  hands back EMPTY output**, which a case reads as "nothing found". A step
  whose work grows with the tree takes `shell/4` with a ceiling of its own
  (`test/lint.pl`'s corpus lint has five minutes).
* **A container runs as root**, who writes through a mode of 444: a
  permission check skips by name when `os_uid/1` answers 0
  (`test/stream.pl`).
* **`red: 0` does not mean the suite passed.** Database cases SKIP rather
  than fail with no server -- `zigurat`, `shared`, `tunnel`, `tensors`,
  `zigurat-lib`, `kbs`, `zigurat-tls`, `groups`, `ruler` -- and others SKIP
  for a missing tool (`files` and `trace` want `swipl`, `ray` raylib and a
  live screen, `tensorflow`, `numpy`, `opencv` their libraries,
  `torch-replay` a CUDA toolkit). **Count the SKIPs and run
  `pgrep ziguratip`** before believing a green run; the number of SKIPs is a
  fact about the machine.
* **A red run of `test/translate.pl` prints two reports and only the first is
  true**: `main` fails, the engine backtracks into an earlier choice point and
  re-runs later sections over changed lessons. Read up to the first `RED`.
* **A case that passes alone proves the case; the suite proves the contract
  between cases** (a lesson's last line must be exactly `done`; a library
  loaded as a goal after a module set a flag).
* **A fixture that has to TAKE a while is timed by the clock, never by a
  count.** 1.8.42-1.8.44 made the engine two to three times faster and
  three cases went red for it alone: a cowork job that had to outlive a
  60 ms wait (it waits on an empty channel now), an httpd page that had to
  outweigh a request's fixed cost (timed in-process, sized to 400 ms), and
  `groups`, whose floor of turns caught fewer steps per proof as designed
  (group b moved to a goal with more search). An httpd page gets
  `page_limit` inferences, a million by default, and past them it is a 500
  -- the old slow page never finished, and nothing checked its answer: **a
  timed request checks its status too.** A change to the engine is gated
  with the modules built and a server up; `make EMBED=0` without them
  cannot run these three.
* `scratch/1` names `/tmp/coco_cocolog_test_PID_SEQ`, and `make_directory/1`
  FAILS (does not raise) on a name that is taken; leftovers in `/tmp` plus a
  recycled PID fail a section silently. Not fixed.
* **Before saying something works**, with the owner's go-ahead: `make test`
  with a server up, read every line, count the SKIPs. A change to the
  knowledge base also wants proving **across processes** -- one cocolog
  writing, a second that consulted nothing reading.

## Hazards, each of which has already cost a day

* **A slow suite is usually the server's uptime.** Restart the server first
  (two seconds; check `pgrep -fl 'cocolog -s test/'` so you break nobody's
  run). If a restart does not help, it is the store ageing: deleted rows stay
  under MVCC; `cocolog vacuum` reclaims them (`groups` and `ruler` vacuum in
  setup), or restart on a fresh `data/`.
* **A store wiped under a server that is still dying answers writes and keeps
  none.** `pgrep ziguratip` must print nothing before `rm -rf
  home/data/*`; a clean restart afterwards is the whole cure.
* **Rebuild the Parsi objects after ANY ZiguratIP engine build.** A stale
  `.so` in `$ZIGURATIP_HOME/ld` takes the server down with `symbol lookup
  error`. After an engine rebuild every object there is stale: ZiguratIP's
  `System/` and `demo/` objects, then `make schema` here.
  `nm -u home/ld/*.so` shows who is behind.
* **A red `contention_test` aborts ZiguratIP's `make` after the artefacts are
  built**, and is usually not yours: `writer under readers` is a harness coin
  toss, and a crash shows up a few times in 144 runs. Re-run before believing
  it. (macOS fails `rewrite vs index` -- a recorded, unfixed engine finding.)
* **An index changed in `parsi/01-schema.parsi` comes up EMPTY on a live
  server**, and a `forget` through it deletes nothing. Run `cocolog vacuum`
  right after the restart, before any base is touched. `--embed` rebuilds a
  new index from the rows at its next open.
* **A page and a procedure of the same name are ONE compiled object**, pages
  last; check `parsi/03-pages.parsi` before naming anything in
  `parsi/02-procedures.parsi`.
* **A store is in the writing machine's byte order** and does not travel;
  `byteorder.bin` beside it is checked before open, and a refusal exits 1
  with an empty stdout and the reason on stderr.
* **A clause must fit one page** (8192 by default, ~8014 characters): the
  store sets `clause_max = page - 190 - len(kb)` and `assertz/1` raises
  `resource_error(clause_length)`; a consult reports and goes on. Over the
  wire the client assumes 8192; `$COCOLOG_PAGE_SIZE` says otherwise.
* **A writing process rewrites the whole predicate** (the backend flushes a
  dirty predicate wholesale, ~360 bytes of new store per EXISTING row) and
  the old rows stay dead; every later process is slower. `cocolog vacuum`
  after the write bounds it. `garbage_collect/0` is unrelated: it compacts
  this process's cell array, not the disk.
* **An httpd pool fetches every module predicate per request** unless
  `prewarm/1` ran (`httpd_serve/3` calls it): pre-warm BEFORE spawning
  threads. `library(cowork)` deliberately does not -- the rule is the
  fetches recurring, not the threads existing.
* A base written before 1.2.18 can hold a module's own clauses beside the
  program's (duplicate solutions); `cocolog forget NAME ARITY` cleans one
  predicate.
* A `lock wait timeout` today means a LIVE contending writer (or a server
  older than the rollback-on-disconnect fix).

## Measuring

* **A within-run pair or nothing.** This box drifts ~20 % between runs of one
  build. Compare two builds in ONE round, back to back, and settle a few per
  cent with five alternating pairs; a ratio under ~3x from medians alone
  means nothing on the pooled rigs.
* **An inference count is not a clock, and a clock is not a count.** Count
  inferences (`statistics/2`, `call_metered/4`) to find a cost, time to
  confirm it; a lookup with its first argument unbound is one call in the
  count and every row in the time. **A count is comparable within one engine
  and not across two**: the engine of 1.8.47 counts 19.5 % fewer inferences
  than 1.8.43's for the same 1762 translations of the sample loop's controls
  (with every text the same; the compiled clause, the deterministic call and
  `is/2` came between them), so a baseline kept from an older binary is
  counted again on the new one.
* **Find a cost with the hunk bisection**: take each hunk of the diff against
  the last version out in a copy of the library and count the sentences that
  rose, several copies at a time (counts do not depend on load). A hunk that
  removes a helper other hunks call answers with an error -- no evidence.
* **One rule, one arm.** A fix that lands in the same edit as another has not
  been measured; a change that moves nothing measurable is not shipped. Arm by
  RULE, a group of hunks: a rule split over two hunks (a head variable and a
  body one) is green with either out. A section cannot arm a rule whose check
  lives in another: run the whole case on that arm (a front's `that` clause
  was green in its own section and red in the Ciampi one).
* **Print the md5 of the library under test AND compare it** to the expected
  one, before the first pass and after the last; a round whose two md5s
  differ is void. Revert with `git checkout -- .`, never by naming files.
* **`utime` beside `stime`, never summed** (`/proc/PID/stat` fields 14 and
  15). On the four-vCPU Linux box a cross-vCPU wakeup is a VM exit costing
  ~18 µs (idle vCPUs halt, no haltpoll): a pooled or threaded figure there
  that is system time tracking the `RES` row of `/proc/interrupts` is a fact
  about the microVM, not the engine.
* **A per-call rate is not a volume**; measure the count before building a
  fix on a rate.
* **`pgrep -f`/`pkill -f` match the shell running them.** Match with
  `pgrep -x cocolog` and `/proc/PID/cmdline`, skip `$$`/`$PPID`, and prefer a
  waiter whose condition is the process gone.
* **A knob that tests `!= nil` is ON when empty** (`MVCCS_NO_CACHE=`); use
  `${VAR:+NAME=1}`.
* `contention_test` opens a filebuf store; `STORE_MAP=1` is the path `--embed`
  and the server use. `MVCCS_DEBUG=warn|info|debug sh MVCCS-cicili/build.sh`
  compiles the engine's trace points in (`guard HELD`, `draw STALLED`).
* **`statistics/2` is about the calling thread** (`store_used`, `store_cap`,
  `globalused`, `globalcap`, `trailused`, `trailcap`, `choicepoints`,
  `strings`, `compactions`, `heap_collections`, `cputime`, `inferences`,
  `atoms`, `functors`). Worker threads are invisible to it: count the
  threads first. On macOS `maximum resident set size` undercounts after a
  large realloc moves.
* `perf` is not installed on the Linux box; `/usr/bin/time` is not either
  (use bash's `time`).

## Cicili, as it is actually written

Cicili is Lisp-syntax C. `../cicili/doc/` is the reference (`DOC-C.md`,
`DOC-CPP.md`, `lib-std-c.md`), `../cicili/lib/README.md` the index. Read them
rather than guessing: a wrong guess usually compiles to something that fails
much later.

* **A string literal is raw** and reaches C untouched; it may not end in a
  backslash and cannot contain a newline (a module's Prolog half is joined
  with spaces).
* **`break` and `continue` are bare symbols.** Use `bitand`, `bitor`, `xor`.
* **There is no character literal**: use the macros (`coco-ch-between`) or
  the code with a comment.
* **`defer` is an attribute of a `let`/`var` binding**, not a statement.
* **Lambda-list markers are uppercase** (`&REST`). **A macro emits ONE
  form**; several leave the symbols unregistered. **`new` is a macro.**
* **A function pointer in a variable is a `func` clause in type position**
  (`coco_store_reset` in `lib/kb.cicili`); a static one is
  `(static) (var func hook (ARGS) (out int) . nil)`. As a PARAMETER, the
  definition's list is `((func hook (ARGS) (out int)))` -- one level fewer
  closers than the declaration's `(decl) (func NAME ((func hook …)))`;
  copying the declaration's closers is `unmatched close parenthesis`, from a
  reader that names no line.
* **`for` takes a binding list and a parenthesised step**:
  `(for ((size_t i . 0)) (< i n) ((++ i)) BODY)`; a computed initialiser
  needs `#'`: `(for ((size_t i . #'($ r nvars))) …)`. The wrong form fails
  with `The value 0 is not of type SEQUENCE`.
* **`(out T *)`, not `(out (T *))`.** **A cast takes ONE type token**:
  `(cast u8 x)`, or mask with `(bitand (cast int c) 255)`.
* **A `let` declares locals; `block` does not.** **Indexing is
  `(nth INDEX ARRAY)`**; arrays have at most two dimensions.
* **A dotted initialiser `(var size_t n . 0)` cannot be written inside a
  generic** in this package (`nil` is `cocolog::nil`).
* **A `#define` is invisible to Cicili**: write the number out.
* **`$` chains** (`($ a b c)` is `a.b.c`), `(-> p m)` is `p->m`,
  `(=> o m args)` calls a function in a member.
* **`../cicili/lib/std/c/posix/` already declares the POSIX structs**; what
  is missing is only the C typedef: `(@define (code "pollfd struct pollfd"))`,
  named exactly as std names it.
* **`(code "...")` is the fire escape, not the door** -- C that Cicili cannot
  see. A `;` inside one makes an empty statement (the emitter adds its own),
  which breaks an `if`/`else`. `@ifdef` takes `(code "__APPLE__")`.
* **A file compiled on its own has no `DEFPACKAGE`** (it expands to an
  `EVAL-WHEN` Cicili then reads: `unknown symbol: EVAL-WHEN`).
* **A C library is declared in a binding and called as Cicili.** A
  `(decl) (struct Color (member uchar r) …)` inside a binding's `init-macro`
  emits NOTHING and teaches inference the shape -- how `lib/std/c/posix`
  declares `sockaddr_in` and `lib/net/curl.cicili` libcurl. Worked examples:
  `modules/ray/binding.cicili`, `modules/clay/binding.cicili` (by-value
  structs, `'{ 0 }` initialisers, `(typedef int …)` enums, static struct
  arrays).
* **A C++ library is ONE Cicili file with `(make :cpp #t :compile #f)`**,
  every call and type a Cicili clause over a binding under Cicili's
  `lib/cpp/<lib>/` (a package plus an `init-macro` that emits nothing):
  `lib/cpp/opencv`, `lib/cpp/zigurat`, `lib/cpp/torch`, `lib/cpp/dl`. The
  SDK prototypes are declared RAW inside `extern "C"` before `(coco-sdk)` --
  otherwise C++ mangles them and `use_module` fails with
  `undefined symbol: _Z11coco_m_text…`; the entry and dispatcher sit in
  `(extern-c …)`. Wrapping `(coco-sdk)` in `(extern-c …)` is not the fix.
* **The macro tables emit several things that must not drift apart**
  (`*cell-tags*`, `*operators*`, `*builtins*`, `*turn-outcomes*`,
  `*construct-names*`): **add to the table, never to the generated code.** A
  construct name missing from `*construct-names*` stops the build at
  `no dispatch id`.

## Parsi

`IF cond BEGIN … END`; `<>` for not-equal; names fold to upper case (a column
named `text` collides with the `Text` type, hence `body`); a row must fit one
page (machine state travels in 4000-byte chunks).

## Libraries and modules

**Tier 1 is always present, and `use_module` on it is a no-op nobody here
writes**: the compiled-in `apply builtins dcg files library lists zigurat`
and SWI's own `assoc pairs ordsets yall aggregate ugraphs dcg_basics
dcg_high_order`, vendored unmodified in `lib/swipl` and read at start-up (do
not edit them). Only files swipl also runs (`test/files/*.pl`,
`emacs/test/conformance.pl`) and `test/library.pl` keep such a directive.

**Tier 2 is loaded when asked**, from `$COCOLOG_LIBRARY` (colon-separated),
then `./library`, then `<exedir>/library`, then `<exedir>/lib/swipl` -- the
path is anchored to the binary, so an installed cocolog loads its own
libraries. `library/*.pl` are clauses only (http, httpd, json, xml, html,
ca, kbs, cowork, main, astar, hex, clay_ray, tensor_expr, llm, and
`library/reasoning/`); `library/*.so` are modules built from `modules/`.

**`modules/` holds the loadable modules**, one directory each -- a
`.cicili`, a `build.sh` (`sh modules/NAME/build.sh`), output nobody commits
-- and **none of them is part of `make`**:

| needs nothing | `tcp` `thread` `process` `text` `os` `clay` (Clay vendored, one header) `stream` |
|---|---|
| a BUILT ZiguratIP | `sha` `aes` `der` (libEncoding only) `x509` `tls` `bigint` |
| an external library | `curl` (libcurl), `torch` (libtorch), `tensorflow` (its C API), `ray` (raylib), `numpy` (python3 with numpy and a shared libpython), `opencv` (OpenCV 4 with dnn) |

* **A module holds the engine as an OPAQUE pointer** (`coco_m_new_int e V`,
  never `(-> e m)`). Its entry is `coco-deflibrary`, or for C++ a
  hand-written `coco_library_entry` inside `extern "C"`.
* **What a `coco_m_*_error` returns is the predicate's ANSWER (2: the
  continuation is set), not a status.** A guard written
  `(if (not (helper …)) (return 0))` tests `not 2` and walks on with a ball
  in flight. Pass it through --
  `(let ((int rc . #'(ray_iarg e g 0 (aof x)))) (if (!= rc 1) (return rc)))`
  -- or have the helper answer 0 and carry the raise out in a parameter.
  The tell is a helper that both raises and returns int.
* **A handle is an integer index into the module's own table** (tcp, tls,
  ray, stream), so losing one leaks what it names silently. Probe by
  exhausting the table before and after the code you suspect.
* **`$`-prefixed names must be QUOTED in a module's Prolog half**
  (`'$x509_issue'`), or the half "would not consult".
* **Which library holds a symbol is not guessable, and a miss links fine**:
  `nm -D --defined-only` over `home/lib`, and name every transitive
  dependency on the link line.
* **`current_predicate/1` answers about the knowledge base**, not modules:
  probe a module by catching `existence_error` around a real call.
* **Register modules before spawning threads**: the registry is
  process-wide and unguarded.
* `cocolint`'s index picks `modules/NAME/NAME.cicili` by name; a header
  signature list counts only at column 0.
* **The dialect card cites engine lines by range** (`tools/cocolint/
  traps.jsonl`). An edit ANYWHERE above a cited site moves it; a cite whose
  anchor is unique is accepted as moved, one whose anchor repeats in its file
  is refused until its range is corrected. After touching `lib/` or
  `cocolog.cicili`, run `sh tools/cocolint/tool.sh card --check`.

## The engine: what is not obvious

* **Dispatch is construct, C builtin, module, store, by name AND arity.** A
  C-registered name shadows any clause of that name (`listing/1` shows
  nothing). Grep a predicate name before writing it: **cocolog consults the
  clauses of one name that are not together in the file without a word**
  (SWI warns; cocolint does not), so a helper given an existing name joins
  that predicate.
* **Every builtin is deterministic**, so a failure-driven loop written from
  habit (`retract(H), fail`) runs ONCE -- wrong, not slow. `once/1`,
  `ignore/1` and `\+` are control constructs.
* **A directive is a GOAL.** `coco_directive` answers the ones that act on the
  reader (`op/3`, `set_prolog_flag/2`, `dynamic/1`, `discontiguous/1`,
  `multifile/1`, `module/2`, `use_module/1,2`, `autoload/1,2`,
  `ensure_loaded/1`, `meta_predicate/1`, `if/elif/else/endif`) and calls
  everything else in file order. `initialization(G)` runs after the file is
  read, `initialization(G, now)` where it stands, `initialization(G, main)`
  after the load and then halts. A directive that fails or throws is
  reported in SWI's shapes and the load goes on; **a syntax error is the
  only thing that ends a consult.** A `use_module`/`ensure_loaded` that
  loads nothing is reported the same way (since 1.8.39: SWI's ERROR
  `source_sink ... does not exist`, then the failed directive; it used to
  be SILENT), except SWI's names for what cocolog carries elsewhere --
  `error`, `dcg/basics`, `dcg/high_order`, `lb_carried` in
  `lib/library.cicili`. A module is claimed BEFORE its consult,
  so a goal directive in a module (and every `-s` program is one) no longer
  re-consults it.
* **Consulting a file REPLACES the clauses it put in the store last time**
  (per-clause `origins`; `'$from'(Path, Clause)` on the wire); asserted
  clauses and other files' are untouched.
* **An uncaught exception reads as SWI's sentence** (`coco_error_text`):
  `Unknown procedure: main/0`, `Unknown message: Ball`.
* **There is a string type** (cell tag `STR`); `double_quotes` takes `codes`
  (default), `chars`, `atom`, `string`, for the REST of the file, per
  machine, forced back to `codes` across a module load. **A string does not
  survive the store or a channel** -- it comes back as codes (canonical text
  is read with the flag honoured; splitting the readers is the unfinished
  fix).
* **A `throw/1` inside `findall/3`, `forall/2` or `aggregate_all/3` reaches
  the catch around it**, and a `catch/3` whose goal exited stops catching
  (`'$catch_exit'`).
* **`atomic_list_concat/3` with a bound third argument and a non-ground list
  SPLITS**; `/2` cannot split; `atom_concat/3` has `(+,-,+)` and `(-,+,+)` but
  no `(-,-,+)`; `string_concat/3` only `(+,+,-)`. **`sub_atom/5` and
  `sub_string/5` are clauses** walking every position -- use
  `atom_concat/3`, `memberchk/2`, `split_string/4` in a hot path.
* **An unbound first argument keys as 0 and walks the whole predicate**; a
  hit hides it, a miss or a `findall` pays it. To read a predicate's heads,
  `clause/2` enumerates them; calling the goal proves it.
* **A global is found by a scan from the first one made and COPIED on every
  read** (`nb_getval/2`, `b_getval/2`): keep a table small per global, and
  make a global you read often once rather than catching its absence.
* **The six term walks borrow the machine's stacks** (copy, store-put,
  store-get, store-unify, unify, compare: `coco_wframes_take`/`_give`,
  `coco_wpairs_take`/`_give` in `lib/term.cicili`), and the three that
  rename variables borrow its variable map too (`coco_varmap_take`/`_give`:
  an open-addressed table, epoch-stamped so nothing is cleared between
  copies; its hash must spread CONSECUTIVE keys -- a multiply alone put a
  whole clause's variables in one slot). They are iterative so a
  200 000-element list cannot overflow the C stack, and when each walk
  allocated its stack per call, queens took 61% longer (1.8.38's bisection,
  STATUS.md). A walk must not `malloc` per call; anything new on that path
  is measured with `sh bench/langs.sh` or a same-sitting pair.
* **`coco_make` dereferences every argument it stores**, which is what keeps
  the continuation from becoming a REF chain and the engine from going
  quadratic; `test/engine.pl` guards it with a hundred-fold-margin timeout.
* **The store compacts itself** at safe points (four million dead cells
  outnumbering the live, or doubling growth); `garbage_collect/0` forces
  one; a caller holding cell indices registers them
  (`coco_store_root_push`).
* **The heap is collected since 1.8.36** (`coco_heap_gc`, a sliding
  mark-compact that keeps cell order, so heap marks stay true): at a step
  boundary, on the OUTERMOST engine of a machine, under a host that set
  `e->gc` -- `-s`, `run`, `query`, the REPL, `step`, `run_isolated/2`. A
  host holding cell indices across a step registers them with
  `coco_heap_root_push` (the REPL's variable table) or leaves `gc` off.
  **Nothing collects inside a nested engine** -- `findall/3`, `forall/2`,
  `aggregate_all/3`, `call_metered/4`, `with_output_to/2`, a directive's
  goal -- so a long deterministic phase in one still keeps its heap
  (50-120 bytes an inference) until it ends: copy such a phase out through
  `findall/3` (`cl_kept/2` in `tools/cocolint/lint.pl` is
  `findall(X, once(Goal), [X])`) or wrap it in `\+ \+`; the linter went
  from 9.7 GB to 58 MB of heap that way. `COCOLOG_GC_CELLS=N` sets the
  threshold (2000 tortures it, and children inherit it),
  `statistics(heap_collections, N)` counts them, and a `_G` name is a heap
  position, so it changes across a collection. The float, string and atom
  tables are never reclaimed.
* **The atom, functor and predicate tables are hashed** (open addressing, an
  entry its id plus one, kept under half full -- checked BEFORE the probe, so
  a failed rehash still leaves an empty slot). Ids stay in order of first
  use, which a frozen machine relies on; `coco_name_arity_hash` serves the
  functors (`lib/term.cicili`) and the predicates (`lib/kb.cicili`). Each
  table has exactly one writer (`coco_functor_id`, `coco_pred_make`); keep
  it that way. The functor also remembers which module owns a goal of its
  name (`dmod`/`dgen`, since 1.8.42): the `strcmp` walk over the modules
  runs once per functor per registry generation, and `coco_module_register`
  raises `coco_extern_generation` so a name nobody owned is asked again.
  **That is true only of a dispatcher whose claim is the name and arity**: a
  hand-written one that turns a goal down by its arguments or its state
  (torch: `tensor_execution/3`, every `tensor_*` under another backend)
  calls `coco_m_decline` first, a walk with a decline in it keeps nothing
  on the functor, and an owner that declines sends the call through the
  whole walk (1.8.45; MODULES.md). A module that declines without saying so
  leaves the functor with the knowledge base after a first declined call.
* **A clause is COMPILED the first time it is selected** (`coco_clause_code`
  and `coco_clause_run` in `lib/kb.cicili`, since 1.8.44): a head program --
  the WAM's GET and UNIFY instructions over a frame of the clause's
  variables, a nested structure flattened through a temporary, READ or
  WRITE mode per structure -- and a body program that builds the goals top
  down through the frame and lists their roots, which go on the
  continuation as `'$k'` frames exactly as a copied body did -- N frames
  reserved in one growth check (`coco_k_push_roots`, 1.8.46). The frame
  lives for the one call (an array, not a heap object: 128 slots on the C
  stack, past that the machine's kept `cslots`), so nothing new is
  frozen and a clause asserted while its body runs cannot move the body
  under it. The code is keyed by the clause's cell in a table on the
  store, cleared when the store compacts and dropped clause by clause
  where one dies (`coco_code_drop`: retract, reconsult -- without it a
  retract-and-assert counter held a program per dead clause, 298 MB at a
  million rounds); a constant is its cell and a functor its id, so a
  compaction cannot stale it. **The predicate keeps a copy of each
  clause's program pointer** (`coco_pred.codes`, since 1.8.46), a fifth
  array parallel to `clauses`: every site that shifts, drops or renumbers
  the clause list moves it too -- asserta, retract, `coco_pred_forget_from`,
  the compaction's second pass (which nils it: the table is about to be
  cleared) -- and a sixth array would go to the same five places. **The
  body program is a layout** (1.8.46): a goal's root word carries the
  cells the goal takes, each ARG word the offset of its slot (K) and of
  the cell it fills (N), the executor reserves the goal once and keeps no
  stack; a program ends at its length (no END word). **Each number in an
  instruction has its own field** -- a frame index or a slot offset in 24
  bits, an argument index, an arity or a cell offset in 32;
  GET_STRUCT once packed two into 16 bits each and a head structure of
  65 536 arguments read back wrong (1.8.45) -- and a clause past what a
  field holds is not compiled. A clause the compiler
  cannot take (a head that is not callable, a frame over 2^24 - 1 slots) or
  whose program cannot RUN (`coco_clause_run` answers -1: no memory) is
  matched in the store and copied as before (`coco_store_unify`,
  `coco_store_get_vm`: the store is
  never bound, a variable met first lives in the slot `coco_push_struct`
  reserved). The engine's own names and functors -- `'$k'`, `$true`,
  `$fail`, `$cut`, `:-`, the markers -- are interned once per machine
  beside the ids (`fids`, `coco-fid`); add to `*functor-names*`, never
  call `coco_make` with a literal name on a hot path. A `'$k'` frame is
  four cells with the barrier an INT in its slot. **A deterministic call
  gets no choice frame** (1.8.46): the engine asks `coco_pred_probe` for
  the first candidate and whether a second exists, and with none tries the
  clause over the machine's own marks with `nchoices` as the barrier --
  what the frame's index would have been; under trace a frame is pushed
  as before, the Fail port is printed from it. **The evaluator dispatches
  by id** (`*arith-names*`, interned beside the dispatch names; a symbol
  in that list is a COCO_OP_* array, for the three names a Cicili string
  cannot end): add an evaluable functor to the table, never a `strcmp`;
  two integer leaves under `+`, `-`, `*` are combined in `coco_arith`
  without the recursive asks. **A raise inside the loop is never
  `return`ed**: `coco_raise` answers 2 when a catcher took the ball and
  the continuation is the recovery goal, so the loop goes round
  (`continue`); three sites returned the 2 through 1.8.45 and
  `catch(call(_), E, true)` ended the query with exit status 2 and no
  message (`test/errors.pl`, "an unbound or non-callable goal is
  catchable"). What is left is the interpretation of the built goals:
  the loop's dispatch, the builtins' argument reading, and the
  continuation itself -- the second half of the compile step, which
  would change the continuation's shape and is the owner's decision.
* **`sort/4` (and so `keysort/2`) is a stable merge sort**; `library(process)`
  spawns with `posix_spawn` (`fork` is refused for a process whose one
  merged mapping exceeds RAM+swap) and RAISES when it cannot spawn.
* **stdout is block-buffered into a pipe**: `flush_output/0` before
  blocking, or a marker never arrives.
* **A grammar rule's leading terminal is stored in its head**, as SWI's
  `optimise_unify` does.
* **Concurrency shares nothing**: a `library(thread)` thread gets its own
  machine, store, engine and database connection; a channel copies terms in
  canonical text. Mutexes and conditions serialise the WORLD (a file, a tcp
  handle, the terminal); an atom names a process-wide lock; use
  `with_mutex/2`. An httpd `workers(N)` request runs through
  `run_isolated/2` (fresh store, its own connection, one commit), so pages
  must be loaded with `use_module` -- consulted or asserted pages are a
  silent 404 in a pool.
* **`library(stream)`** owns the stream table and ISO's stream names
  (`open/3,4`, `set_output/1`, `read_term/3`, …). `format/3` and
  `with_output_to/2` reach it through a sink hook
  (`coco_m_sink_install`); `set_output/1` redirects fd 1 with dup/dup2. The
  stdout sentinel for `format/2` is `(cast size_t -1)`, not 0 (cell 0 is a
  real heap cell). cocolint's X2 trap is lifted by a
  `use_module(library(stream))` directive.

## The document libraries

`library(json)`, `library(xml)`, `library(html)` (with CSS) go both ways:
writers answer CODES, readers take codes or an atom, all six halves are DCGs.
**The round trip is the test** (`test/serialize.pl`). **A code list is a
list**: `str(X)` is how text is said. **They throw rather than guess**, naming
the term. `xml.pl` reads no DTD (XXE is impossible, an undeclared entity is an
error); `html.pl` leaves an unknown entity as text, refuses `</script` inside
`script`/`style`, has no indent option, and is NOT an HTML5 tree builder.
`html.pl` reuses `xml.pl`'s escaper by name; the UTF-8 encoder is copied on
purpose.

## Cryptography and TLS

`sha`, `aes`, `der`, `x509`, `tls` and the clauses-only `library(ca)`:
**arithmetic is bound, grammar is Prolog, policy is clauses.** **Keys are
files, never terms** (a key in an atom would reach the trail, channels and the
store); a pass phrase arrives by `getenv/2`. `X509::issue`'s issuer argument is
a NAME CONFIGURATION, not a certificate. `certificate_public_key` yields the
SPKI's contents; `der_wrap(48, K, S)` puts the header back.

* **A client certificate is optional for TLS and mandatory for
  permissions**: under `SECURITY/PERMISSIONS_MODE` a plain connection reaches
  everything, TLS without a certificate nothing, with one what it grants.
* **Under TLS 1.3 a missing client certificate is not a failed handshake**:
  `SSL_connect` succeeds and the refusal arrives on the first read; a test
  checks what the peer REACHES.
* `library(tls)` is `library(tcp)` with a handshake: the stream stays in the
  module, a handle is a slot, every refusal FAILS (`tls_why/1` says why).
  `library(httpd)` does HTTPS through tagged connections
  (`plain(S)`/`secure(S)`); the peer's identity reaches a page as
  `Tls-Peer-Subject`/`Tls-Peer-Permissions`, stripped from the client's
  request on both transports.
* The one TLS client unit is `client/tls.c` (`coco_client_tls_*`); a failed
  Zeytun fetch prints its reason on stderr.

## The reasoning library and the translator

`library/reasoning/`: `reason.pl` (controlled English as a DCG, questions,
explanations, topics), `normalise.pl` (the generator of tagged training
pairs), `tagger.pl` (a GRU tagger over `tensor_expr`, plus the deterministic
judge `tagger_sane/2` and repair `tg_repair/3`), `translate.pl` (sentences
read into an English-worded IR and written into any lesson's language),
`teach.pl` and `page.pl`. Cases: `test/reason.pl`, `normalise.pl`,
`tagger.pl`, `translate.pl`; lessons 43-46 in `tutorials/library/`.

**Where the data is, and who reads it:**

| path | what | rebuilt by |
|---|---|---|
| `corpus/*.txt` | hand lessons, one sentence a line -- **the TAGGER's corpus** | hand |
| `corpus/extra/<lang>.txt`, `extra/eng-*.dix` | lines and dictionary entries Apertium lacks or gets wrong -- vocabulary only, never read by the tagger, written FIRST | hand |
| `corpus/vocabulary/*.txt` | ~110k Italian and ~139k Spanish lesson lines, committed | `corpus/build.pl` from `corpus/raw/` (`tools/corpus/fetch.sh`, not committed) |
| `generated/`, `model.rows` | the training pairs and the shipped model, committed | `tools/tagger/train.sh` |
| `lexicon/*.txt` | WordNet and census words, committed | `tools/lexicon/build.sh` |

* **A change to `corpus/*.txt` is a data change for the tagger**: regenerate
  `generated/` and `model.rows`, and expect a minority shape to re-roll. A
  word that is vocabulary rather than a shape goes in `corpus/extra/`. A
  training is deterministic, so retraining unchanged data fixes nothing.
* **Rebuild the vocabularies after the LAST line of `extra/`**:
  `test/translate.pl`'s `build` section rebuilds the Spanish file in a scratch
  corpus (with `raw/` and `extra/` symlinked) and requires it byte for byte.
  Read a rebuilt vocabulary for what it LOST (a set diff), not only what it
  gained.
* **A line of `extra/` has two readers**: it comes first for its WORD and
  for its MEANING, so it moves the reader of one language and the writer of
  the other. Say the dictionary's own word again first where the line must
  not become the word written.
* **A store learns only the lines it lacks**, appended: an ORDER is a
  property of a teach, not of a line. A data fix is proved on a store taught
  from the rebuilt vocabulary. Teaching both languages into one `--embed`
  store takes ~11 and ~18 minutes.
* **Memory**: a teach sat at 4-9 GB resident before the heap collector of
  1.8.36 and peaks near 1 GB since (the Spanish pass, measured on 1.8.40), a
  tagger training is near 10 GB, `test/tagger.pl` alone; on a 14-16 GB box run
  the big ones apart -- a cocolint run
  beside a teach was OOM-killed (exit 137) when the linter still reached
  10 GB; the corpus lint peaks near 3.5 GB now. A killed process never
  flushes. **An arm that removes half of a coupled change can loop and grow
  its heap past 13 GB** (a clause left with an unbound variable): run arms
  under `ulimit -v`, and never beside a teach -- the OOM killer took both.
  `tagger_tag_all/3` keeps a batch's intermediate tensors: tag big grids a
  sentence at a time.
* **A small case lesson reproduces a fault only when it gives the word every
  role the vocabulary does** (and every form: a lesson with one participle
  form cannot test agreement). A guard is proved by an ARM that puts the
  first cut back and goes red; a guard whose arm is green proves nothing.
* **A right text is not a right IR.** English IS the IR; translate into
  English to see what crossed. A refusal with `unknown: []` is a missing
  SHAPE; one that reads into English and refuses into the target is a target
  vocabulary gap.
* **The owner's sample loop** (one article at a time, alternating directions,
  until an article needs no change): build the shapes; add `extra/` lines;
  rebuild and teach a fresh store; then the CONTROLS -- every earlier article
  plus Tatoeba's 400, this translator against the last version's on the one
  store, twice -- and the DATA COLUMN, the last version's translator on its
  own store against the new store, the only place a line of data shows. Fix
  every regression, find every cost by hunk bisection, add a section to
  `test/translate.pl` and to lesson 46, record the stated costs. Controls run
  BEFORE the commit. **Merge `origin/master` before the teach** when it moved
  the engine, so the numbers belong to the binary that is committed, and **run
  the whole `test/translate.pl` (two minutes) before it**: a section alone
  cannot see an older section's check -- the Cecchi section was green for days
  and the whole case had eight red. Read the controls' TEXTS, not only their
  counts: they found a pronoun lost (`lo`), a committee made the object, `ma
  non` written last, a sentence that ran to the 300 M inference limit and
  `l'anima` as `lo anima`; and sum the counts by hunk -- a clause that reads
  the phrase's words a second time at every place that read nothing cost 3 %.
* **Open leads, recorded and not done**: `tr_cap_run/3` is two predicates
  under one name; the builder calls a noun a person only by its first English
  word; English has no irregular plurals (`mans`); the upstream verb table
  has `scaping`/`leaved`; `No comas el pan.` reads the subjunctive before the
  negative imperative; `pronto` after a verb crosses as `immediate`; `ir a`
  and an infinitive is the near future and reads as a verb of motion, with
  the infinitive's clitic on it (`nos vamos a quedar` is `ci andiamo a
  rimanere`); Spanish `advertir a los suyos` takes a direct object in
  Italian (`avvertì ai suoi`); `da` before a bare noun is `desde` (`una fama
  desde hábil niño`); `portarsela dietro` is an idiom and crosses word by word
  (`traersela atrás`); a contraction before a quoted article drops
  the opening mark (`de "la casa"` is `della casa"`); a lesson line gives a
  word ONE sense in both numbers (`competencias` are powers, `la competencia`
  the rival firms, and the line for the first moved the second); `su` for the
  owners of a plural crosses as `il suo` (`su futuro` of the shops);
  `afectar a` keeps its `a` (`influire negativamente alle centrali`); an
  adjective after two coordinated nouns agrees with the nearest (`centrali e
  gruppi di spesa spagnola`); `se si elevasse` crosses as `si se elevó`, the
  imperfect subjunctive written as a past indicative; `del quale` is `de
  quién`; `un altro milione` is `un otro millón`; `insomma` at the head of a
  clause is written at its end (`en resumen`); `in termini percentuali` is
  `en porcentajes plazos`; the clitic `ne` crosses as `lo` (`ne potranno
  beneficiare` is `lo podrán beneficiar`); `da` after coordinated participles
  is `desde`; an adjective after a quoted noun agrees with the nearest noun
  outside the marks (`"reddito minimo di inserimento" francese` is
  `francesa`, `si chiama "minimo vitale"` is `se llama "mínima vital"`);
  English writes `Non sono pochi` as `Few are not` and moves a quotation's
  marks to the edges of its phrase; a name of one capital word and an
  adjective (`Roma antica`) is not read.

## Tutorials are documentation that runs

`tutorials/` holds 125 files -- `basics/` 11, `library/` 49, `opencv/` 23,
`tensor/` 42 -- and `test/tutorials.pl` runs them all (300 s a lesson, 600 s
for opencv, 900 s for `library/45-tagger`). **Every claim is a `must/3`**,
repeated at the bottom of each file so a lesson can be copied anywhere; a
lesson that stops being true FAILS, naming both answers. **A lesson's last
line is exactly `done`.** Lesson 46's `main/0` once grew past a page
(cocolint Z1): move sections into predicates of their own.

## macOS

The whole family builds on a Mac; each of these fails naming something other
than its cause:

* **Shared objects and test binaries leave interpreter symbols undefined**:
  `tools/cc` adds `-Wl,-undefined,dynamic_lookup` to every Darwin link, and
  `COCO_WEAK`/`CE_WEAK` are `weak_import`.
* **There is no `/proc/self/exe`**: `lb_exedir` asks `_NSGetExecutablePath`;
  programs read `current_prolog_flag(executable, P)`.
* **`make schema` dies in libc++** (`binary_function` removed): copy the home
  config, add `-D_LIBCPP_ENABLE_CXX17_REMOVED_BINARY_FUNCTION` to
  `CPP_FLAGS`, run `ZIGURATIP_CONF=that-file make schema`.
* **A raylib photograph is one frame behind**: draw a frame twice before a
  screenshot or a pixel read. **A sleeping screen opens no window**
  (`GLFW: Failed to determine Monitor`); `test/ray.pl` probes and SKIPs;
  `caffeinate -u` wakes it.
* **XQuartz ships XTEST off**: `defaults write org.x.X11
  enable_test_extensions -boolean true`, restart X11.
* **Ask `library(os)`, not a shell** (`os_is/1`, `os_has/1`,
  `os_lib_path_var/1`, `os_tmp/1`, `os_cpus/1`). No `setsid`, BSD `date`
  has no `%N`, BSD `wc` pads, BSD `sed` ignores `\|`.
* A server's READY line comes ~1.4 s before its port opens, and a page that
  warms a store is ~4x slower than on the Linux box.

## Where things are

| path | what |
|---|---|
| `cocolog.cicili` | the composition root: CLI, options, the version |
| `lib/term.cicili` | cells, unification, the trail, copying |
| `lib/syntax.cicili` | the reader and the writer, one operator table plus `op/3`'s |
| `lib/kb.cicili` | the clause store, its five backend hooks (`fetch`, `on_assert`, `on_retract`, `on_dynamic`, `warm`), compaction |
| `lib/solve.cicili` | the engine, the builtin table, error text |
| `lib/module.cicili`, `lib/sdk.cicili` | the module seam and the SDK an out-of-tree module is written against |
| `lib/library.cicili` | `use_module`, the library path, directive goals |
| `lib/builtins.cicili`, `lists`, `apply`, `files`, `dcg`, `state` | tier-1 modules (`files` has `get_time/1`) |
| `lib/zigurat-kb.cicili`, `lib/zeytun-kb.cicili` | the binary-protocol and HTTP backends |
| `lib/swipl/` | SWI's vendored libraries -- do not edit |
| `client/` | pure C wire client; `client/tls.c` the one TLS unit |
| `embed/` | the embedded store, part of the binary |
| `parsi/` | schema, procedures and pages compiled into a ZiguratIP home |
| `modules/` | the nineteen loadable modules |
| `library/` | tier-2 Prolog libraries and the built `.so` files |
| `tools/cocolint/` | the dialect linter (`lint.sh FILE.pl`), its card (`traps.jsonl`, citations checked with `tool.sh card --check`), the retrieval index (`tool.sh index`), the oracle |
| `tools/cc/` | the compiler wrappers |
| `tools/cloud/` | `docker-build.sh`: the Docker images on a Claude Code session's Linux box |
| `test/` | the suite: `run.pl`, `prelude.pl`, the cases and their fixtures |
| `tutorials/` | the lessons |
| `bench/` | cocolog against CPython and SWI-Prolog (`sh bench/langs.sh`; SWI with `-O` and as installed, run on the same `.pl` files), moved from The Coco with every run; `test/langs.pl` guards its pairs |

**A feature that touches the knowledge base must consider all three
arrangements**: local (no hooks), Zigurat (all five hooks), Zeytun (`fetch`
and `warm` only -- one HTTP request is one transaction).
