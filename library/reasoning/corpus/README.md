# library/reasoning/corpus

Controlled English that TEACHES, kept as data: one file a lesson, one
sentence a line, in the English `library(reasoning/reason)` reads -- a word
between quotation marks is MENTIONED and stands for itself, so `The noun
"casa" means "house".` is `noun(casa), mean(casa, house)`. A line beginning
`#` is a comment.

| file | what |
|---|---|
| `spanish.txt` | the Spanish lesson of `test/translate.pl` and `tutorials/library/46-translate.pl`: 176 lines, the vocabulary as facts about words, the grammar as rules over the classes |
| `italian.txt` | the Italian lesson learned beside it under its own name: 123 lines -- the articles, the copula and the auxiliary in their forms, the negation, the question words, the pronouns, the possessives, the prepositions and their contractions |
| `vocabulary/spanish.txt` | the VOCABULARY, written by `build.pl` and never by hand: some eighty thousand lesson lines in the same shapes -- 22 000 words with their genders, plurals, persons and every verb's sixteen forms -- out of Apertium's dictionaries |
| `vocabulary/italian.txt` | the same for Italian, some sixty thousand lines |
| `build.pl` | the program that writes `vocabulary/`: `cocolog -s library/reasoning/corpus/build.pl -- spanish` |
| `raw/` | Apertium's dictionaries and pattern's English verb table, which `tools/corpus/fetch.sh` downloads (pinned to their commits) and which are NOT committed: 30 MB, and what `build.pl` writes from them is |

**THE HAND-WRITTEN FILE IS THE GRAMMAR AND THE WRITTEN ONE IS THE WORDS.**
`spanish.txt` says what the rules are -- gender by ending, the plural's
endings, where an adjective stands, the word that denies, the question
words -- and gives a few words to say them with; `vocabulary/spanish.txt`
gives twenty-two thousand more in the same sentences, `The feminine noun
"casa" means "house".`, `"comió" is the past of "come".`, `"amigo" is a
person.`, and a gender denied of the word whose ending would mislead the
rule (`"problema" is not feminine.`). A program learns the grammar first
and then the words -- `library/reasoning/teach.pl` does both, into whatever
knowledge base the process proves against, which under `--embed` is a
store every later process finds taught in a second where the learning
takes six minutes for Spanish and three for Italian -- and `library/reasoning/page.pl` translates a file
sentence by sentence over it. The vocabulary directory is NOT read by the
generator: the tagger's lesson shapes draw from the lessons beside it,
not from eighty thousand lines of dictionary.

The sources, and their licences: `apertium/apertium-eng-spa`,
`apertium-spa`, `apertium-eng-ita` and `apertium-ita` (GPL-2), the
bilingual and monolingual dictionaries; `clips/pattern`'s `en-verbs.txt`
(BSD-3), for the English pasts and participles -ed cannot make; WordNet's
noun.person by way of `lexicon/class.txt`, for which nouns are persons.

Three things read this directory, and none of them holds a word of it:

* `library(reasoning/normalise)` generates its LESSON shapes from the words
  in here -- the mentioned words, the classes said of them (`noun`,
  `article`, `pronoun`), the adjectives (`feminine`), the forms (`the plural
  of`, `the first person of`), the relations (`means`, `precedes`, `takes ...
  in the plural`) -- through `normalise_lexicon/2` with `mention`, `wclass`,
  `wadj`, `form`, `wverb`, `wobj` and `wplace`, and lists the lines
  themselves with `normalise_lessons/1`. A lesson that uses a shape or a
  word these files lack is one the tagger was never shown, and the fix is a
  line here, not a word in the code.
* `library(reasoning/tagger)`'s judge lets a sentence about a mentioned word
  be related only by a verb some lesson here uses, and
  `tagger_lessons/4` measures the shipped tagger on these lines with their
  quotation marks taken off -- `The noun casa means house.` -- read back to
  the same terms.
* `tools/tagger/train.sh` trains on the generator, so every word here is
  in the shipped model's world.

`$COCOLOG_CORPUS` names another directory; otherwise it is
`reasoning/corpus` under the first library directory that has one, as the
lexicon beside it is found. Nothing trains on data the tree does not hold:
a sentence worth teaching the tagger goes in a file here, and the file is
committed.
