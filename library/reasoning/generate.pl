%% library(reasoning/normalise) makes a pair from a seed and nothing else,
%% so the corpus is reproducible from the code, the lexicon and the
%% lessons -- and it is still written down, because data a training used
%% and nobody can read back is data lost the moment a shape, a lexicon
%% file or a lesson line changes under it. Two files, one canonical term
%% a line (normalise_save/2, read back by normalise_load/2):
%%
%%     library/reasoning/generated/training.txt      seeds 1..N, the pairs tagger_train/2 fits
%%     library/reasoning/generated/evaluation.txt    seeds 30001..30000+M, the pairs
%%                                                   tagger_evaluate/4 measures on: sentences
%%                                                   the training never saw
%%
%% The negatives -- real sentences the tagger must refuse -- are not
%% generated: lexicon/prose.txt holds them, and the lessons are in corpus/.
%% A generator is a .pl in this library and its output is committed beside
%% the lexicon and the corpus, which is the rule for every file under
%% library/reasoning: nothing trains on what the tree does not hold.
