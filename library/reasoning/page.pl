%% Over a knowledge base teach.pl has taught. Each sentence of the file
%% comes out as its translation, or as `?' with the words no lesson knows,
%% and the last line counts both. The second argument names the language
%% to translate INTO, as reason_translate/3 takes it; without it the words
%% decide. A THIRD names the language the page is IN, and then the page
%% goes from one language to the other through the intermediate
%% representation, with no English sentence written -- which wants both
%% lessons in the store, each taught under its own name.
