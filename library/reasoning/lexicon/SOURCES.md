# library/reasoning/lexicon

The words `library(reasoning/normalise)` generates from, one class a file,
one word a line, the commonest first. The library reads them the first
time a word is asked for and drops, as it loads, whatever the grammar
would not read as an open word: a closed word (`will` is a modal before it
is a name) and a verb whose third person does not stem back to it.

| file | class | source |
|---|---|---|
| `proper.txt` | first names | the United States Census Bureau's 1990 frequency lists, public domain: the 1500 commonest female and 1000 commonest male names, capitalised |
| `noun.txt` | things | WordNet 3.0, a word whose first sense is in `noun.animal`, `noun.artifact`, `noun.food`, `noun.object`, `noun.plant` or `noun.possession` |
| `class.txt` | kinds of person | WordNet 3.0, first sense in `noun.person` |
| `place.txt` | named places | WordNet 3.0, first sense in `noun.location` and an instance (a city, a country, a river), capitalised |
| `adj.txt` | adjectives | WordNet 3.0, `adj.all` and `adj.pert` |
| `adverb.txt` | adverbs | WordNet 3.0, `adv.all` |
| `vt.txt` | verbs that take an object | WordNet 3.0, any sense with the frame "Somebody ----s something", "... somebody", "Something ----s something" or "... somebody" |
| `vi.txt` | verbs that take none | WordNet 3.0, a sense with "Something ----s" or "Somebody ----s" |
| `vpp.txt` | verbs before a phrase | WordNet 3.0, a sense with "Somebody ----s PP" or "Something is ----ing PP" |
| `prose.txt` | real sentences, the grammar's opposite | WordNet 3.0's example sentences, quoted in its glosses: 8000 of two to twenty words, capitalised and stopped, in a fixed hash order -- the negatives a tagger learns to refuse (`normalise_negatives/3`) |
| `known_noun.txt`, `known_verb.txt`, `known_adj.txt`, `known_adverb.txt` | every word the judge knows | every SemCor-counted lemma of that part of speech, whatever its sense, commonest first, each once: not the generator's words but the tagger's -- `tagger_sane/2` refuses a tagging they contradict, and `death` as a subject slipped through while only the generator's concrete nouns were known |

The WordNet files are ranked by the tag counts of SemCor, the sense-tagged
corpus WordNet ships as `cntlist.rev`, so a cap keeps the words English
uses and leaves the obscure ones out. `tools/lexicon/build.pl`, a cocolog
program, writes every file but `proper.txt` from a WordNet 3.0 `dict`
directory (`apt install wordnet-base`; `sh tools/lexicon/build.sh`), and
`proper.txt` is the census list as it is.
