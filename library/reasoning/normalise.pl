%% cocolog -- library(reasoning/normalise): the generator that teaches a text
%% normaliser, and the assembler that reads what it learns.
%%
%%     :- use_module(library(reasoning/normalise)).
%%
%% TIER 2, clauses only, and it needs nothing but library(reasoning/reason). The
%% network this feeds is NOT in here: this file is the part every later
%% number depends on, and the part that runs on a box with no torch.
%%
%% WHAT A NORMALISER IS, HERE. library(reasoning/reason) reads a controlled English
%% and refuses everything else, and the way to reach it from typed prose is
%% a network that says, for every token, WHAT IT IS -- the subject, the
%% relation, the object, or noise -- so that Prolog can rebuild the
%% sentence in the shapes the grammar reads. That network is a TAGGER, not
%% a writer: it never emits a word, it labels the ones it was given, so a
%% proper noun it has never seen is copied and never guessed, and a bad
%% label costs a refusal, never a malformed term.
%%
%% THE GRAMMAR IS THE DATA. No corpus of (prose, controlled English) exists,
%% and this file makes one from the grammar's own shapes: normalise_pair/2
%% builds a clean sentence WITH its gold tags -- the generator knows which
%% word is the subject as it puts it there -- and then applies NOISE
%% TRANSFORMS that carry the tags along: a filler phrase (tagged D, drop),
%% a hedge (`I think that', D), an adverb after the subject (D) or after an
%% intransitive verb (D), a prepositional adjunct (D), a relation written
%% as two words (R R, to be joined), an
%% emphatic `does' (D), two sentences joined by `and' (B, a boundary), and
%% a filler or a hedge right after that `and' (D) -- the position typed
%% prose puts them in and the generator did not, until `Priya is a baker
%% and, as far as I know, Priya is licensed' tagged the `and' as an object;
%% and a second fact about the SAME subject joined by `and', its subject
%% left out (`Priya is a baker and is licensed') or a pronoun (`and she is
%% licensed'). The assembler supplies the subject a break left out, and the
%% grammar resolves the pronoun: state carried from sentence to sentence.
%% Every transform is one the assembler can undo by dropping, joining or
%% splitting -- and none changes a word's FORM, because a tag cannot: a
%% plural, a passive, a pronoun are not in this set, and this header says
%% so rather than leaving it to be found.
%%
%% TWO KINDS OF NOISE ARE KEPT OUT ON PURPOSE, measured against the
%% grammar. A bare word after an indefinite object -- `owns a car too',
%% `owns a car now' -- is not refused but MISREAD, as the noun of the
%% phrase, so an adverb goes at the end only after an intransitive verb.
%% And a place is NEVER noise. After an intransitive verb -- `works in
%% Rome' -- it is the relation work_in, shape 9 with a phrasal verb, and
%% dropping it once taught the network to drop `lives in Lagos' too. After
%% an object -- `rents a flat in Rome' -- it is the third argument of
%% rent_in, shapes 23 to 26; while a transform dropped it there the network
%% dropped `rents a flat in Bristol' to `rents a flat'. So no transform
%% appends a preposition and a proper noun, and pp_extra's adjuncts are
%% lower-case throughout (`at home', never `on Monday'), because a
%% capitalised word after a preposition after an object is a place the
%% grammar reads.
%%
%% AND QUESTIONS ARE SHAPES TOO, twelve of the fifty-five: `Does Alice own
%% a car?', `Is Alice happy?', `May Alice use the server?', `Who owns a
%% car?', `What does Alice own?', `Where does Alice sleep?', `Does Alice pay
%% 500 euros?', `How much does Alice pay?', `How many euros does Alice
%% pay?', `How much is the rent?', `Why is Alice happy?', `Why does Alice
%% own a car?'. The tags are the statements' -- `who' is the
%% subject asked for, `what', `where', `how much' and `why' the object -- so the
%% assembler copies them where they stand, the text ends in `?', and the
%% grammar reads a goal with a variable there.
%%
%% AND QUANTITIES ARE EIGHT SHAPES: `Alice pays 500 euros', `Alice buys
%% two litres of milk', `Every tenant must pay 500 euros', `The rent is 500
%% euros' (the one definite subject the grammar reads), `Alice does not pay
%% 500 euros', and the three questions above. A number is a determiner to
%% the tagger -- T before the noun it counts, digits or the number words
%% (`twenty five', `a hundred'), the `of' of `two litres of milk' a K --
%% and the assembler copies it where it stands, so the grammar reads
%% quantity(500, euros). The nouns are units (lexicon/unit.txt, WordNet's
%% units of measurement and of time) and things, pluralised by the
%% inflector, because a plural is the form a number takes.
%%
%% AND A LESSON IS TEN SHAPES, WHOSE WORDS ARE A CORPUS. A language lesson
%% is written about WORDS -- `The feminine noun "casa" means "house"',
%% `"leche" is feminine', `"amigo" is a person', `"los" is the plural of
%% "el"', `Every noun that ends in "a" is feminine', `Every verb that ends
%% in "e" takes "n" in the plural', `The word "no" precedes the verb',
%% `Spanish is a language' -- and a word in quotation marks is MENTIONED:
%% it stands for itself, whatever it is. The tag for one is M, the
%% thirteenth, and it is the one tag that ADDS something when the
%% assembler undoes it: a token tagged M is written between quotation
%% marks, a run of them as one mention (`a el'), so `The noun casa means
%% house', typed as prose is typed, comes back as the lesson's own line.
%% No word of a lesson lives in this file: the mentioned words, the
%% classes said of them (noun, article, pronoun), the adjectives
%% (feminine), the forms (`the plural of', `the first person of'), the
%% relations (means, precedes, `takes ... in the plural') and the class
%% atoms (`the verb', `in the plural', `a vowel') are read out of the
%% lessons in library/reasoning/corpus/ -- one sentence a line, in the
%% controlled English itself -- by the shapes' own patterns
%% (normalise_lexicon/2 with mention, wclass, wadj, form, vq, vqin, vin,
%% vthe, wobj, wplace, wkind, wlang, ending, letter), and a lesson that
%% needs a word or a shape the corpus lacks gets a line there, not a word
%% here. The meanings and half the mentions are ordinary lexicon words
%% besides, because any English word can be mentioned. Two transforms
%% are theirs: `unquote', the marks taken off (at seven pairs in ten,
%% because that is how prose writes a word about a word, and the tagger
%% must read the quoted form too), and `in_language' -- `in Spanish' at
%% the end of a fact about a mention, or `In Spanish,' at the head, tagged
%% D, the grammar refusing the first because a sentence that mentions a
%% word names no place. Inside the apposition a language is an ADJECTIVE
%% kept (`The Spanish noun "casa"' is spanish(casa) besides, which is
%% true), because dropping it would have taught the network to drop an
%% adjective. What a tag still cannot do holds here too: `Nouns that end
%% in -a are feminine' changes three forms, and is not made.
%%
%% ---- THE SURFACE ------------------------------------------------------
%%
%%     normalise_pair(+Seed, -Pair)
%%     normalise_pair(+Seed, +Options, -Pair)
%%         Pair = pair(Noisy, Tokens, Tags, Clean, Applied): the noisy text;
%%         its tokens as reason_tokens/2 gives them, the final stop dropped;
%%         one tag a token; the controlled text the noise was made from; and
%%         the names of the transforms that applied. Deterministic in Seed.
%%         Options: transforms(Names) restricts the candidates, so
%%         transforms([]) is a clean pair; always(true) applies every
%%         candidate that fits, where the default is a coin a transform.
%%
%%     normalise_corpus(+N, -Pairs)
%%     normalise_corpus(+N, +Options, -Pairs)          seeds 1..N
%%
%%     normalise_save(+Pairs, +File)
%%     normalise_load(+File, -Pairs)
%%         The pairs as DATA: one canonical pair(...) term a line, written
%%         with writeq/1 and read back with term_to_atom/2, so what a
%%         tagger trained on is a file in the tree and not a seed somebody
%%         has to re-run the generator for. library/reasoning/generate.pl
%%         writes the shipped model's corpus to
%%         library/reasoning/generated/, and tagger_train/2's pairs_file(F)
%%         trains on it; the pair is the same term normalise_pair/2 gives.
%%     normalise_generated_dir(-Dir)
%%         Where generate.pl writes: $COCOLOG_GENERATED, or
%%         `reasoning/generated' under the first library directory that has
%%         a `reasoning', made when it is missing.
%%
%%     normalise_negatives(+From, +N, -Pairs)
%%         N real sentences from prose.txt beside the lexicon -- WordNet's own
%%         example sentences, in a fixed hash order -- from the From-th, as
%%         pairs whose every tag is X and whose Clean is `none': what a
%%         tagger must REFUSE, and what tagger_refused/4 measures it
%%         against. A seventh of them the grammar reads as they are, nearly
%%         all two words -- `Vulpine cunning.' as the Name-verb fact
%%         cunning(vulpine) -- which is why a tagging is judged by the
%%         lexicon and not by the grammar alone.
%%
%%     normalise_assemble(+Tokens, +Tags, -Text)
%%         The inverse: D dropped, a run of R joined with `_', B a sentence
%%         break -- and a sentence the break leaves with no subject (no S,
%%         and no M before its relation) takes the subject phrase of the
%%         one before it -- a run of M written as ONE mention between
%%         quotation marks, a quoted token as itself, everything else
%%         copied in its case; each sentence capitalised and stopped. What
%%         the tagger's output is handed to, and what the round trip below
%%         holds the tags to.
%%
%%     normalise_bare(+Text, -Bare)
%%         The text with its mentions written bare -- `The noun "casa" means
%%         "house".' as `The noun casa means house.' -- the way prose writes
%%         a word about a word, and what tagger_lessons/4 puts to the
%%         tagger; a mention that would not survive as words (`"¿"', a
%%         sign the tokeniser drops) keeps its marks.
%%
%%     normalise_lessons(-Lines)
%%         Every line of every .txt file in the corpus directory, in file
%%         and line order, comments and blank lines dropped: the lessons the
%%         shapes' words come from.

%%
%% ---- THE TAGS ---------------------------------------------------------
%%
%%     S  the subject head      Q  a quantifier (every)      C  the condition's adjective
%%     R  a relation word       K  a structural word kept as it is: `that', `does',
%%                                 the copula inside a relative clause
%%     N  not                   T  a determiner               A  an adjective -- and the class
%%                                                              noun of an apposition, `the NOUN "casa"'
%%     O  the object head       D  drop                       B  a sentence boundary
%%     M  a MENTIONED word, written between quotation marks: the subject or
%%        the object of a lesson's sentence, the letter a rule is over
%%     X  OUTSIDE: not a sentence of the grammar's at all -- the tag a tagger
%%        gives real prose it cannot normalise, and the assembler refuses
%%
%% Only D, R, B and M change what the assembler emits; the rest are copied,
%% and X is refused. The generator never emits X: a tagging comes back X
%% throughout when library(reasoning/tagger)'s lexicon rules contradict it,
%% and normalise_negatives/3 hands out real sentences tagged X throughout to
%% measure that against. Without a no the first tagger labelled `Boston,
%% Mass.' S R and the grammar read mass(boston); taught to the network as a
%% twelfth label it cost a tenth of what the tagger should read, so the no
%% is the lexicon's.
%% They are still worth teaching: a network told WHAT each kept word is
%% learns the sentence's shape, not only which words to lose, and an
%% assembler that one day reorders (a passive) will need them.
%%
%% ---- THE ROUND TRIP IS THE CONTRACT -----------------------------------
%%
%% For every pair: assemble the noisy tokens with their GOLD tags, parse
%% the result with reason_text/2, and it must give the same terms as the
%% clean text -- up to the names of a rule's variables. test/normalise.pl
%% holds 300 pairs to it. That is the proof that the tag scheme carries
%% enough to recover the sentence, which is the only thing that makes it a
%% possible target for a network; and the proof that every noisy text is
%% REFUSED by the grammar is what makes the noise noise.
%%
%% ---- WHAT THE NETWORK WILL AND WILL NOT LEARN ----------------------------
%%
%% It learns to undo the transforms written here. Prose has more, and the
%% grammar refuses what the tagger gets wrong -- so the cost of the gap is
%% refusals, measured by the acceptance rate on real text, and the next
%% transform to write is whichever refusal is commonest. And a well-formed
%% WRONG sentence is possible: swap S and O and `Rome owns a house' parses.
%% The grammar guarantees form; tag accuracy is the correctness number.
%%
%% THE NOISE IS DETERMINISTIC IN THE SEED, the way the tensor lessons draw
%% their data: a hash of the seed and a salt, not a random number, so a
%% corpus is reproducible and a failing pair can be named by its seed.

%% and prose is WordNet's example sentences, real English, for
%% normalise_negatives/3 --
%% written by library/reasoning/lexicon/build.pl (cocolog, not Python:
%% the parse of WordNet's files is a DCG's job). SOURCES.md beside them says where each
%% came from and under what licence. NO WORD LIVES IN THIS FILE.
%%
%% The files are read the first time a word is asked for, held as globals
%% of this machine -- never asserted, so a knowledge base is never written
%% -- and FILTERED BY THE GRAMMAR as they load: a word library(reasoning/reason)
%% treats as closed is dropped (`will' is a modal before it is a name), and
%% a verb whose third person does not come back to it through the stemmer
%% is dropped, so the inflection round trip holds by construction. Modals
%% are the grammar's own, asked of rl_modal/1. $COCOLOG_LEXICON names
