%% TIER 2, and clauses only. Its grammar is a DCG over tokens, the way

%% so parsing and interpretation are one walk. Nothing is called out to.
%%
%% THE LEXICON IS DATA. Four dynamic predicates say what a word is --
%% reason_noun/1, reason_adj/1, reason_verb/2, reason_proper/2 -- and a
%% program extends them with assertz/1 like any other fact. They are
%% consulted FIRST; when they are silent, POSITION decides: the last word of
%% a noun phrase is its noun, every word between the determiner and that
%% noun is an adjective, and the word after the subject is the verb. So the
%% examples above parse with an empty lexicon, and a lexicon entry is how a
%% program says a word is not what its position suggests. The closed
%% classes -- determiners, quantifiers, modals, the copula, `does', `not',
%% `that' -- are fixed, because those are the words the grammar is made of.
%%
%% ---- THE SURFACE ------------------------------------------------------
%%
%%     reason_text(+Text, -Terms)
%%     reason_text(+Text, +Options, -Terms)
%%         Text is an atom, a string or a code list; sentences end at `.',
%%         `!' or `?'. Terms is a list: facts, neg/1 facts, and rules
%%         written (Head :- Body), each one a term assertz/1 will take.
%%         Indefinite individuals are NAMED, car_1 then car_2 across the
%%         whole text, unless Options carries variables(true).
%%
%%     reason_learn(+Text)
%%     reason_learn(+Text, -Terms)
%%         reason_text/2, and every term asserted: the text is knowledge
%%         now, its rules run, and reason_ask/2 answers about it.
%%
%%     reason_sentence(+Text, -Terms)
%%     reason_sentence(+Text, +Options, -Terms)
%%         One sentence, with no state: a subject pronoun in it is refused.
%%         The grammar is DETERMINISTIC by construction --
%%         the noun is the last word of its phrase and the closed classes
%%         are fixed -- so there is one reading or none; a program that
%%         adds grammar clauses of its own gets its readings on
%%         backtracking, which is the engine's search and needs nothing
%%         from here.
%%
%%     reason_tokens(+Text, -Tokens)
%%         The tokeniser, exposed. A token is word(Lower, upper|lower),
%%         num(N) for digits (500, 5.5, 1,000; `5%' is 5 and the word
%%         percent), quoted(Word) for a word between quotation marks, `.'
%%         or `,'. A byte past 127 is part of a word, so `pequeño' is one.
%%
%%     reason_refused(+Text, -Sentence)
%%         The first sentence reason_text/2 would refuse, as its words
%%         joined by spaces -- and every later one on backtracking. FAILS
%%         when the whole text parses. reason_text/2 refuses a paragraph
%%         whole and says nothing; this is how a caller finds out which
%%         sentence to rewrite.
%%
%%     reason_question(+Text, -Question)
%%         One sentence read as a question: question(Goal) for yes or no,
%%         question(X, Goal) with X for what `who', `what' or `where' asks.
%%         The forms are under THE QUESTIONS IT READS, below.
%%
%%     reason_ask(+Text, -Answers)
%%         Every question in Text answered against the knowledge base as it
%%         stands, one answer each in order; the statements in Text are
%%         read for their state and asserted by nobody. A yes-or-no
%%         question answers yes(Why), no(Why), unknown or conflict --
%%         truth/2's verdict, with the fact or the rule it rests on -- and a
%%         who, what or where question a list of Value-Why, empty when
%%         nobody. Neither this nor reason_question/2 resets the state, so
%%         `Is she licensed?' may follow the paragraph that introduced her.
%%         A `Why ...?' question answers because(Text), the explanation
%%         below, or unknown.
%%
%%     reason_ask(+Text, -Answers, -Explanations)
%%         The same, with the EXPLANATION beside each answer: the proof in
%%         sentences (reason_explanation/2) for a yes, the denial as said
%%         for a no, `Nothing shows that ...' for unknown, and for a who,
%%         what or where question a list of Value-Text.
%%
%%     reason_explain(+Goal, -Why)
%%         The whole proof of a goal, every level of it: fact(G) when G was
%%         said; rule(G, Whys) when a rule gave it, with the why of every
%%         goal of its body; absent(G) for a \+ G that held because nothing
%%         proves G, denied(G) when neg(G) was said besides; forall(A, B,
%%         Instances) for \+ (A, \+ B), a universal -- every square the
%%         king may move to is unsafe -- with each instance's own why;
%%         holds(G) for a builtin, holds(\+ G) for one that fails (`"perro"
%%         does not end in "a"'); conj(Whys) for a conjunction asked.
%%         Fails when nothing proves the goal; reason_why/2 is one level of
%%         this.
%%
%%     reason_explanation(+Goal, -Text)
%%         That proof in sentences, depth first: `Kh8 is checkmated because
%%         Kh8 is a captive and nothing shows that Kh8 is defended. Kh8 is
%%         a captive because ...', one sentence per rule, `as said' for a
%%         fact at the top, and `whenever Kh8 may move to X, X is unsafe
%%         (X: G8, G7 and H7)' for a universal, each instance explained
%%         after it. A goal nothing proves is tried as its denial, so a
%%         denied goal explains as `..., as said.'; fails otherwise. The
%%         words are the knowledge base's own: a verb in the third person
%%         (reason_third/2), a proper noun the reader met capitalised, a
%%         class noun it met after `a', `the' or `every' with its article,
%%         any other atom as `the ...', an individual car_1 as `the car'.
%%
%%     reason_concepts(+Terms, -Concepts)
%%         What the terms MENTION: concept(Name, Kind, Mentions), the most
%%         mentioned first, ties in order of first mention. Kind is name (a
%%         proper noun the reader met), individual (flat_1), class (a noun:
%%         king in king(kh8), `the rent' as an object), property (attacked),
%%         or relation (attack, may_move_to); a mention is one occurrence in
%%         a fact, a denial, an amount, or a rule's head or body.
%%
%%     reason_topics(+Terms, -Topics)
%%         The terms as an OUTLINE: topic(Subject, Kind, Subtopics), one per
%%         subject something is said about -- a name, an individual, a class
%%         atom, and the class or property a rule defines -- the most said
%%         about first, ties in order of first mention. Subtopics is a list
%%         of Group-Items in order of first mention: class-[king],
%%         property-[black], relation(occupy)-[[h8]], relation(rent_in)-
%%         [[flat_1, bristol]], denied-[pay(marco, rent)], amount-
%%         [quantity(600, euros)]; members-[kh8] under a class, rules-[Rule]
%%         under the class a rule quantifies over, definition-[Rule] under
%%         the class or property its head names; and by(attack)-[Claim]
%%         under the object of a claim, what is said of it from the other
%%         side.
%%
%%     reason_topic_lines(+Topics, -Lines)
%%         Topics as lines, one atom each: `Kh8, a king: black; occupies H8;
%%         may move to G8, G7 and H7.', `Square (G8, G7 and H7): every
%%         square that is attacked is unsafe; ...', `Unsafe: a square that
%%         is attacked; ...', `H8: Kh8 occupies it; Re8 attacks it.'
%%
%%     reason_outline(+Text, -Lines)
%%     reason_outline_prose(+Text, -Lines)
%%         reason_text/2, or the shipped tagger over typed prose, and then
%%         the topics as lines.
%%
%%     reason_third(+Base, -ThirdPerson)
%%         The inflector, rs_base/2's inverse: own -> owns, watch ->
%%         watches, carry -> carries, have -> has. library(reasoning/normalise)'s
%%         normalise_third/2 is this.
%%
%%     reason_prose(+Text, -Terms)
%%     reason_ask_prose(+Text, -Answers)
%%     reason_ask_prose(+Text, -Answers, -Explanations)
%%         TYPED prose, not the controlled English: the shipped tagger
%%         normalises it first, then reason_text/2 or reason_ask/2 reads
%%         what came out. OPTIONAL, and loaded on first use --
%%         library(reasoning/tagger) and the model beside the library
%%         (tagger_pretrained/1 there), which need library(torch) and the
%%         embedded engine. Without them the call raises
%%         existence_error(tagger, pretrained), and nothing else here
%%         changes.
%%
%%     reason_why(+Goal, -Why)
%%         The REASON a ground goal holds: fact when it was said,
%%         rule(Head :- Body) with the body as it proved when a rule gave
%%         it (one level), denied when its negation was said; fails when
%%         nothing holds it up.
%%
%%     reason_amount(+Object, -Quantity)
%%         What `how much' asks for: the quantity the object IS -- a
%%         quantity/2,3 term or a bare number -- or, for a class atom, the
%%         amount the text gave it: after `Nadia pays the rent. The rent is
%%         500 euros.' the object `rent' answers quantity(500, euros). The
%%         goal a how-much question reads to calls it last.
%%
%%     reason_count(+Object, +Noun, -N)
%%         What `how many NOUN' asks for: N when the object is
%%         quantity(N, Noun) or quantity(N, Noun, Of). The goal a how-many
%%         question reads to calls it last.
%%
%%     end_in(+Word, +Suffix)         end_with/2, begin_with/2, start_with/2
%%         What a rule over WORDS asks: `Every noun that ends in "a" is
%%         feminine' is feminine(X) :- noun(X), end_in(X, a), and these
%%         four are the library's so that the rule RUNS. Both atoms; and
%%         `a vowel' or `a consonant' in place of the letters -- `ends in
%%         a vowel' is end_in(X, vowel) -- the five vowels and their
%%         accented forms being the vowels.
%%
%%     reason_base(+Word, -Base)
%%         The stemmer, reason_third/2's inverse: owns -> own, has -> have,
%%         carries -> carry -- and houses -> house, boxes -> box, since a
%%         noun's plural is made the same way.
%%
%%     truth(+Goal, -Truth)
%%         true, false, unknown or conflict, for a GROUND goal against the
%%         knowledge base as it stands: what a text said, what it denied,
%%         what it never mentioned, and what it contradicted. The whole
%%         argument is below, under FIVE DECISIONS.
%%
%%     reason_closed(?Name/Arity)          dynamic; see truth/2
%%
%%     reason_name(+Terms, -Named)
%%         What reason_text/2 does last: every variable is named after the

%%
%% A subject is a proper noun or a quantified class; an object is a proper
%% noun or a determined noun phrase. A place after an object joins the
%% relation -- `rents a flat in Rome' is rent_in/3, the place its last
%% argument -- exactly as a preposition written joined to a bare verb does
%% (`lives_in Rome' is live_in/2, the verb inside it stemmed): after a bare
%% verb the two words are ONE relation and are written as one, so `sleeps
%% in Rome' is refused where `sleeps_in Rome' is read, and it is
%% library(reasoning/normalise)'s assembler that joins them. Which is also
%% why `Alice owns a house in Rome' is a fact about a house in Rome and
%% `Alice sleeps in Rome' is not a fact at all: only after an object can the
%% preposition belong to nothing else. A paragraph carries ONE piece of
%% state from sentence to sentence, the subject of the last fact, and
%% `she', `he' or `they' as a subject stands for it -- so `Alice is a
%% baker. She is licensed.' is two facts about Alice, and `She is licensed'
%% with no fact before it is refused. That is the one coreference this
%% reader does: `it' is left alone (`It rains' is not about anybody), and
%% a pronoun as an object is refused. A QUESTION IS A GOAL, the term the
%% statement would have asserted with a variable where the question word
%% stood, and reason_ask/2 answers it against the knowledge base with the
%% REASON beside the answer: the fact that was said, the rule and the
%% body that proved it, or the denial. AND `WHY' ASKS FOR THE WHOLE
%% PROOF: `Why is Kh8 checkmated?' answers because(Text), where Text is
%% every level of the proof in sentences (reason_explanation/2) -- the
%% rule that gave the claim, each goal of its body, and what gave each of
%% those, down to what was said; a universal in a body, \+ (A, \+ B),
%% is `whenever A, B' with every instance explained. A QUANTITY IS A VALUE, NOT AN
%% INDIVIDUAL: a number and the noun it counts -- `500 euros', `three
%% vineyards', `5.5 percent', `two litres of milk' -- reads as
%% quantity(N, Noun) or quantity(N, Unit, Noun), the noun AS WRITTEN
%% (euros, not euro, by the rule below), the number as digits or as the
%% number words (`twenty five', `two hundred', `a hundred'), and a bare
%% number as the number. No car_1 is introduced for `three cars', because
%% three of them is not one, so the object of the claim is the quantity
%% term itself, in a fact, a rule and a denial alike -- must_pay(X,
%% quantity(500, euros)) :- tenant(X); neg(pay(bob, quantity(500,
%% euros))). `The rent is 500 euros' is the one sentence with a definite
%% SUBJECT, and it is amount(rent, quantity(500, euros)): what a definite
%% object costs, said once and asked for by `how much'. A quantity
%% carries no adjective (`three red cars' is refused, not read with `red'
%% dropped) and no comparison (`more than 500 euros' is refused). A
%% CONDITION IS A RELATIVE CLAUSE -- `that is [not] ADJ', `that is [not]
%% a NOUN', or `that [does not] VERB [OBJECT]' -- and it is deliberately
%% the ONLY way: `if ... then ...' with a pronoun would need the pronoun bound
%% inside a rule, and a rule with two conditions is two sentences or one
%% relative clause per condition. A WORD IN QUOTATION MARKS IS MENTIONED,
%% NOT USED, and stands for itself: `"casa" means "house"' is mean(casa,
%% house) whatever the words are -- `"a"' is the letter and not the
%% article, `"is"' a word and not the copula -- and `the noun "casa"',
%% `the feminine article "la"' say what the word is besides: noun(casa);
%% article(la), feminine(la). A quoted word stands as a subject, as an
%% object, and -- with a determined noun, as its class atom -- after a
%% preposition after a BARE verb, where a place is refused: `ends in "a"'
%% is end_in(X, a) and `ends in a vowel' end_in(X, vowel), because
%% neither can belong to anything but the verb, and end_in/2 knows the
%% two letter classes. `is the NOUN of X' is a relation the noun names,
%% plural_of(los, el), mother_of(alice, bob); and a place after an object
%% may be a definite phrase, `keeps the tractor in the barn' being
%% keep_in(omar, tractor, barn). That is how a LANGUAGE LESSON reads --
%% vocabulary as facts, grammar as rules over the classes and end_in/2 --
%% and library(reasoning/translate) is the translator over it, asking the
%% knowledge base and knowing no word of the language itself. What it
%% does not read it REFUSES, by
%% failing -- reason_text/2 fails on the first sentence that does not
%% parse rather than skipping it, because a paragraph half understood is
%% worse than one refused; reason_refused/2 then names the sentence.
%%
%% ---- FIVE DECISIONS, EACH WITH ITS REASON -----------------------------
%%
%% A NOUN IS TAKEN AS WRITTEN. `All employees are people' gives
%% people(X) :- employees(X): no plural comes off, because a rule that
%% strips an `s' from a noun turns `bus' into `bu' and `glass' into
%% `glas', and a program that wants the singular writes it.
%%
%% A VERB IS REPORTED IN ITS BASE FORM. `Alice owns a car' and `Bob does
%% not own a car' must name ONE predicate or no rule can mention both, and
%% the surface forms differ (`owns', `own'). So a third-person `-s' comes
%% off, `has' becomes `have', and reason_verb/2 overrides: assertz(
%% reason_verb(owns, owns)) keeps the surface form if a program wants it.
%%
%% AN INDEFINITE OBJECT IS AN INDIVIDUAL IN A FACT AND A CLASS EVERYWHERE
%% ELSE. `Alice owns a car' asserts that some car exists -- so a fresh
%% individual, car_1, and the fact car(car_1) beside own(alice, car_1).
%% `Bob does not own a car' asserts that NO such car exists, and a fresh
%% car_2 would assert one; `Every employee has a badge' has no single
%% badge for the head of a rule to name. Both report the object by its
%% class atom: neg(own(bob, car)), have(X, badge) :- employee(X). Prolog
%% has no existential in a head and no negative fact, and this is the
%% honest projection onto what it has, written where a reader will see
%% it rather than left to be discovered.
%%
%% A DEFINITE OBJECT IS THE CLASS ATOM. `the server' names THE server, the
%% one this program is about, so it is the constant `server' -- which is
%% what a rule wants: may_access(X, server). A program with several
%% servers writes their names.
%%
%% NEGATION IS neg/1, NOT \+/1. A negative SENTENCE is knowledge -- `Bob
%% does not own a car' is something the text said -- and \+ is a question
%% about provability, which is not the same claim. neg/1 is a term a
%% program can assertz, query and reason over as it likes; the one place
%% \+ appears is the BODY of a rule from `that is not', where "not
%% provable" is exactly what a rule condition means.
%%
%% A RULE DECLARES WHAT ITS BODY NAMES, because otherwise it throws.
%% `\+ exempt(X)' over a knowledge base with no exempt/1 in it is an
%% existence_error, not a failure -- SWI's rule too -- so `every tenant that
%% is not exempt must pay the rent' would throw at the first tenant unless
%% somebody had also been declared exempt. reason_text/2 therefore calls
%% dynamic/1 for every predicate a rule's body mentions, at the moment it
%% hands the rule back: the promise that every term is one assertz/1 takes
%% is only worth keeping if the rule then RUNS. Found by the lesson, whose
%% twelfth section named nobody exempt.
%%
%% A MODAL JOINS ITS VERB. `may access' is may_access/2 and `must submit'
%% is must_submit/2, because a modality is part of what is claimed and a
%% predicate name is where a claim's shape lives. `may' and `must' as
%% separate wrapper terms would be a deontic logic, which this is not.
%%
%% truth/2 IS FOUR-VALUED, AND THAT IS ONE MORE THAN WAS ASKED FOR. Prolog
%% answers yes or no, and no means "not provable", which is not "false":
%% a knowledge base that never mentioned cats cannot deny that Tom is one.
%% So truth(G, T) asks two questions -- does G prove, does neg(G) prove --
%% and reads the pair:
%%
%%     G proves, neg(G) does not      true      the text said it
%%     neg(G) proves, G does not      false     the text denied it
%%     neither proves                 unknown   the text never said
%%     BOTH prove                     conflict  the text contradicted itself
%%
%% The fourth is the one a three-valued answer would hide: a paragraph that
%% says `Alice is happy' and `Alice is not happy' has told you something,
%% and answering `true' about it because the positive fact was found first
%% is not reading the text, it is reading the clause order. A predicate that
%% does not exist proves nothing and is `unknown', not an error: the whole
%% point of the value is that silence is an answer.
%%
%% AND A PROGRAM MAY CLOSE A PREDICATE. Sometimes the text IS the whole
%% truth -- a roster, a list of who is exempt -- and then not-provable
%% really is false. assertz(reason_closed(exempt/1)) says so, and truth/2
%% answers `false' for exempt(X) it cannot prove. It is opt-in, per
%% predicate, and the default is open, because the text that gives you
%% every fact about a predicate is rarer than the one that gives you some.
%%
%% THE GOAL MUST BE GROUND. truth(own(bob, X), T) is not a question with a
%% truth value, it is a search -- and `true' for "some X proves" beside
%% `false' for "some other X is denied" would be two quantifiers wearing
%% one word. A variable raises instantiation_error; findall/3 is the tool
%% for the question that was meant. And the class-atom decision above
%% reaches here: neg(own(bob, car)) makes truth(own(bob, car), T) false and
%% leaves truth(own(bob, car_1), T) unknown, because the projection kept
%% the class and lost the individual. That is the cost, stated.
%%
%% ---- WHAT IT IS NOT ---------------------------------------------------
%%
%% It is not a parser of English. It reads a controlled subset -- the
%% shapes above and nothing else -- and a program that wants more writes
%% grammar clauses of its own beside these, the way a library(httpd) page
%% is written beside the server. It does not resolve pronouns, so `Alice
%% bought a car. She uses it.' is two sentences of which the second fails.
%% It reads a prepositional phrase only where it can belong to one thing:
%% a place after an object (`rents a flat in Rome', `keeps the tractor in
%% the barn'), and a mention or a determined noun after a bare verb's
%% preposition (`ends in a vowel', `sleeps at the house'); a proper noun
%% after a bare verb is refused, because `sleeps_in Rome' is that
%% relation's written form. What it cannot place it REFUSES rather than
%% misreads: `Alice owns a house in Rome' once came back as rome(rome_1),
%% house(rome_1), in(rome_1), own(alice, rome_1) -- the position rule
%% taking the last word for the noun -- and that is worse than a refusal.
%% Prepositions are closed, so a phrase that fits nowhere is left over,
%% the sentence fails, and reason_refused/2 names it.
%% It does not read a conjunction, and refuses one BY RULE: `Alice and
%% Bob' parsed as and(alice, bob) while `and' was an open word, and a
%% sentence refused only because its tail did not fit is one misreading
%% away from being accepted. `and', `or' and `but' are closed.
%% It does not read compound nouns: `an identification number' is a
%% `number' that is `identification', by the position rule, and a program
%% that means one word writes identification_number. And it decides nothing
%% about truth: what comes out is what the text SAID, shaped for a
%% knowledge base, and whether it is so is the rest of the program's job.

%% Every nonterminal carries the TERMS its phrase contributes. A subject
%% is either a constant (a proper noun) or a variable with a guard -- the
%% class goals a rule's body will need -- and `Ctx' says which: `fact'
%% for a proper subject, `rule' under a quantifier. An object read under
%% `rule' or under negation is a class atom; under `fact' an indefinite
%% object is a fresh variable with its noun and adjectives as terms.

rs_sentence(Terms) --> rs_sentence(Terms, _).

%% ---- questions ---------------------------------------------------------
%% `?' is a stop like `.', so a question is known by its first word. It
%% reads to the GOAL the statement would have asserted, with a variable
%% where `who', `what' or `where' stood:
%%

%% a stem that takes -es rather than -s: it ends in ss, sh, ch, x, z or o.
%% A SINGLE s OR h IS NOT ENOUGH: `uses' is use+s, not us+es, and the first
%% draft answered `us' -- and `clos', `rais', `bath'. Found by writing
%% library(reasoning/normalise)'s inflector, which this must invert exactly:
%% normalise_third/2 there and the four rules above are one pair, changed
%% together. The -ies rule wants two letters before it, so `dies' and `lies'
%% are die+s and lie+s rather than dy and ly, and `carries' is carry. What
%% no rule can settle -- `buses' from bus, `belies' from belie, `aches' from
%% ache -- reason_verb/2 is there for, and library(reasoning/normalise)
%% DROPS from its lexicon as it loads: a verb whose third person does not
%% come back to it here is never generated, so the round trip holds by
%% construction.

%% library(reasoning/normalise)'s normalise_third/2 is this, and the
