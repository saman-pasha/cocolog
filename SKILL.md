name: cocolog
description: Use for any work in or with cocolog, the Prolog whose knowledge base is a database — writing, porting from SWI-Prolog, running or debugging a Prolog program on it (the dialect, the builtins, the libraries, the store, threads and green threads); tensor programs with library(tensor_expr) over torch or tensorflow; drawing a predicate or explaining a failed, raised or slow query with the flow libraries (flow/chart, flow/debug, tools/flow); linting with cocolint; and changing cocolog itself — the engine in Cicili, a loadable module, a library, a suite case or a lesson. Read it before writing a line of Prolog or Cicili here, even for a small script, because cocolog reads like SWI-Prolog and differs exactly where a ported program does not look (one namespace, codes for double-quoted text, 64-bit integers, a prefix operator's atom, a store that outlives the process).

# SKILL — working in cocolog

cocolog is a Prolog. Its language is ISO Prolog as SWI-Prolog 9.0.4 runs it,
held to swipl's answers case by case. What is its own is the **knowledge
base**: a runtime arrangement — memory, a store embedded in the process, a
ZiguratIP server, Zeytun over HTTP — in which a clause is a row, and a running
proof is a term that can be frozen into rows and resumed by another process.
It is one binary, written in **Cicili** (C in S-expressions).

Version at the time of writing: cocolog 3.62.0, reasoning 1.0.33, built with
Cicili 3.3.0. `./cocolog --version` answers the first.

**Part A** is for writing and running Prolog on cocolog. **Part B** is for
changing cocolog itself. Each section stands alone: go to the one the task
names.

| the task | read |
|---|---|
| run a file, a goal, a script with arguments | §1 |
| write a program, or port one from SWI-Prolog | §2, §3, then lint it (§11) |
| find a predicate or a library | §4 |
| keep facts between processes, a server, transactions | §5 |
| threads, green threads, a pool | §6 |
| tensors, a network, training | §7 |
| what a predicate CAN do, and what is wrong in it | §8 |
| why a query failed, raised, or took so long | §9 |
| trace, backtrace, lint | §10, §11 |
| write a lesson or a suite case | §12 |
| change the engine, a module, a library | Part B: §13 to §16 first |

The documents, and what each one answers:

| file | answers |
|---|---|
| [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) | the owner's standing rules, the build's hazards, one bullet for each mechanism of the engine. Its rule wins over this file |
| [`README.md`](README.md), [`MORE.md`](MORE.md) | what cocolog is; the long form of every feature |
| [`COMPAT.md`](COMPAT.md) | every difference from SWI-Prolog and ISO, each row with what to write instead |
| [`MODULES.md`](MODULES.md) | how a module is written; the compiled-in libraries, one section each |
| [`TRACING.md`](TRACING.md) | the tracer, backtraces, a recorded window, the journal |
| [`STATUS.md`](STATUS.md) | what is proven, release by release, with its numbers |
| [`DESIGN-flow.md`](DESIGN-flow.md), [`DESIGN-compiling.md`](DESIGN-compiling.md) | the plans behind the flow libraries and the clause compiler |
| [`tutorials/`](tutorials) | 133 lessons that run: the fastest way to learn one library |
| [`tools/cocolint/GUIDE.md`](tools/cocolint/GUIDE.md) | the linter, the dialect card, the retrieval index |
| [`../cicili/SKILL.md`](../cicili/SKILL.md), [`../cicili/lib/README.md`](../cicili/lib/README.md) | the language of the C half, and its declarations |

When this file and `CLAUDE.md` disagree, `CLAUDE.md` has the owner's current
rule. When a document and the source disagree, the source wins. When cocolog
and swipl 9.0.4 disagree and `COMPAT.md` has no row for it, that is a bug.

# Part A — Prolog on cocolog

## 1. Run a program

```sh
./cocolog run FILE.pl                  # consult FILE, prove main
./cocolog run FILE.pl 'goal(X)'        # ... or this goal
./cocolog run a.pl b.pl main           # several files: the LAST argument is the goal
./cocolog -s FILE.pl -- ARG ...        # load FILE as a module, prove main
./cocolog query 'member(X, [a, b])'    # prove a goal and print every answer
./cocolog                              # the toplevel: ?- , ; for more, halt.
```

- **`run` consults; `-s` loads a module.** A consulted file's clauses are the
  program's own: with a store (§5) they are written into it, replacing what
  the file put there last time. `-s FILE` is `use_module(FILE), main`: the
  clauses are a module's, never written to a store, and every thread and
  isolated proof sees them (§6). Under the default `--local` the two look
  alike until a thread or a store is involved. A tool or a server is `-s`; a
  program whose clauses are the data is `run`.
- `run a.pl b.pl` with no goal reads `b.pl` as the goal (`Unknown procedure:
  b/0`). Name the goal when there is more than one file.
- `run` and `-s` print only what the program prints. `query` prints each
  answer as the goal instantiated, ten at most (`--answers N`, 0 for all).
- **Exit status** of `run` and `-s`: 0 proved, 1 failed (nothing is said), 2
  an uncaught error (its message and a backtrace on stderr), N after
  `halt(N)`. `query` exits 0 whether it answered or printed `false.`, and 1
  on an error.
- **A program's arguments come after `--`**:
  `current_prolog_flag(argv, [Exe|Args])`. `library(main)` parses them: define
  `main(Argv)` and `opt_type/3`, one row for each spelling of a flag
  (`opt_type(n, count, integer). opt_type(count, count, integer).`), and call
  `argv_options(Argv, Positional, Options)` (lesson 38).
- Write no `:- initialization(main).`: both commands call `main` themselves.
  A file that must also run under swipl says `:- initialization(main, main).`
- stdout into a pipe is block-buffered: `flush_output/0` before the program
  waits for anything.
- `--trace` prints the four ports, `--backtrace` every call an uncaught error
  was raised in, `--no-backtrace` the message alone (§10).
- `./cocolog --help` lists the other commands (`consult`, `forget`, `vacuum`,
  `start`, `step`, `finish`, `work`, `swarm`, `list`, `drop`: the store's
  housekeeping, and machines suspended in it). It leaves out `run`, which is
  as written above.

The binary finds its libraries in `$COCOLOG_LIBRARY` (colon-separated), then
`./library`, then beside itself. Set the variable when a program is run from
another directory against a checkout that is not the binary's.

## 2. The dialect: write SWI-Prolog, then check these

Each row compiles, loads and runs, and does something other than what a
SWI-Prolog programmer expects. The first four are the ones that bite a port.

| you write | what happens here | write instead |
|---|---|---|
| a predicate with a library's name: `append/3`, `step/4`, a grammar `digit//1` | **one namespace.** `:- module/2` is read and import lists are accepted, but every clause is in one store, so yours JOIN the library's clauses | prefix what you define: `shop_total/2`, `shop_digit//1`. A grammar head counts two more arguments. cocolint finds each one (N1) |
| `"text"` | a list of codes, ISO's default | `'text'` for an atom; `:- set_prolog_flag(double_quotes, string).` (or `atom`, `chars`) at the file's head for strings. `sub_atom/5`, `atom_concat/3`, `string_concat/3` and `sub_string/5` refuse a code list |
| an integer past 64 bits | `evaluation_error(int_overflow)` | `library(bigint)`; rationals (`1r3`) are 64-bit too |
| `K == dynamic -> A ; B`, `X = table, G`, `Op = - ^ Y` | a syntax error, as in swipl: a prefix operator's atom before an infix operator | brackets: `(dynamic)`, `(table)`, `(-)`. The atoms: `dynamic discontiguous initialization meta_predicate module_transparent multifile public table thread_initialization thread_local volatile`, `\+`, `-`, `+`, `\` |
| `open/3`, `read/1`, `write/2`, `nl/1`, `tab/2`, `read_term/2` | unknown procedure: the engine has no streams | `:- use_module(library(stream)).` gives ISO's. Without it: `format/3` with a sink (`atom(A)`, `codes(Cs)`, `string(S)`), `with_output_to/2`, `read_file_to_codes/2`, `write_file_from_codes/2`, `term_to_atom/2`, `read_term_from_atom/3` |
| `shell/1`, `thread_create/2`, `tcp_connect/2` | unknown until its module is loaded | `:- use_module(library(process)).` (`sh/1`, `proc_run/4`), `library(thread)`, `library(tcp)` (§4) |
| `:- table p/2.`, `freeze/2`, `dif/2`, `when/2`, attributed variables, dicts, `flag/3`, `recorda/2`, `predsort/3`, `assertion/1`, `random_between/3`, `read_string/3`, a postfix operator | not there, on purpose: an existence error stops a port where a near-copy would differ in silence. `:- table` reads and the load reports `table/1` unknown; `op(200, xf, f)` is a domain error | write it out: `msort/2` or `sort/4`, `must_be/2`, `X is random(N)` |
| `call_with_inference_limit/3` | absent: swipl's keeps choice points this cannot | `call_limited(G, Limit, R)`: commits to the first solution, R is `true` or `inference_limit_exceeded`, fails when G fails. `call_metered(G, Limit, Used, R)` also says what G spent |
| `current_prolog_flag(F, V)` of any flag | fails: twenty flags answer. `set_prolog_flag/2` of an unknown flag is `existence_error(prolog_flag, F)` | keep state with `nb_setval/2`; do not branch on flags |
| `functor(T, '[\|]', 2)` | the list cell is `'.'/2` | `T = [_\|_]`. (`[]` is not `'[]'`, as in SWI 7.) |
| a string asserted into a database store, or sent down a channel | comes back a code list: both carry canonical text | store atoms; convert at the edge |
| `catch(G, error(T, context(_, _)), R)` | misses a loader's error, whose context is unbound, and a refusal, `error(cocolog_error(Text), _)` | `error(T, _)` |
| `current_predicate(N/A)` to probe a library | answers for the program's and the system's predicates, not for a loadable module's | call inside `catch/3` and catch `existence_error` |
| bytes from a socket as text | `library(tcp)` and `library(tls)` read and write BYTES whatever the program counts | cross with `string_bytes(Text, Bytes, utf8)`, as `library(http)` does |

Three more facts hold everywhere:

- **Text is counted in characters**, as SWI counts it. A program that wants
  bytes says `:- set_prolog_flag(text_units, bytes).`
- **A clause must fit one page of a database store** (65 536 bytes on a store
  made by a current build, 8 192 on an older one): `assertz/1` raises
  `resource_error(clause_length)` past it. Chunk big data.
- **Every builtin written in C is deterministic.** The ones that enumerate are
  the ones that enumerate in swipl, and they do here: `between/3`, `member/2`,
  `nth0/3`, `select/3`, `sub_atom/5`, `atom_concat/3`, `clause/2`,
  `retract/1`, `arg/3`, `char_type/2`, `current_op/3`, `repeat/0`.

What is swipl's and worth knowing it is: error terms with their contexts
(`error(type_error(integer, a), context(system:succ/2, _))`) and the messages
printed for them; the logical update view; first-argument and just-in-time
indexing; `setup_call_cleanup/3`; single-sided rules (`Head => Body`); the
determinism guards `$/0` and `$/1`; `print_message/2` with `message_hook/3`;
`term_expansion/2` and `goal_expansion/2`; `:- include/1`, `:- encoding/1`;
cyclic terms; every option of `write_term/2`; `listing/1`'s layout; a float's
text.

[`COMPAT.md`](COMPAT.md) is the whole table, about 150 rows: search it for
the predicate before calling a difference a bug.
`sh tools/cocolint/tool.sh card --card` prints the dialect card, the two dozen
rows a port trips on most.

## 3. Files and loading

- `:- use_module(library(json)).` loads a tier-2 library (§4). **Tier 1 is
  always there**: a `use_module` for it does nothing, and cocolint says so
  (T1). Keep one only in a file swipl also runs.
- `consult/1`, `[File]`, `ensure_loaded/1`, `load_files/2` and `:- include/1`
  are swipl's. A relative name is looked for beside the loading file first,
  then in the working directory, with `.pl` added.
- **A load reports and goes on.** A directive that fails or throws, and a
  clause that does not read, are each reported on stderr in swipl's words
  (`ERROR: FILE:LINE:COL: Syntax error: ...`, `Warning: ... Goal (directive)
  failed`) and the rest of the file loads. So a typo is a predicate with one
  clause less, not a program that stops. Read a load's stderr:

  ```sh
  ./cocolog run FILE.pl true 2>&1 | grep -E 'ERROR|Warning'
  ```

- The load warns as swipl's: singleton variables, a predicate's clauses not
  together, a test the compiler can decide. Every file of this tree loads with
  no warning. Keep it so: a variable used once is `_`, a variable used twice
  is not named `_X`, and a helper goes after the predicate that calls it,
  never between two of its clauses.
- Consulting a file again replaces the clauses it put there last time and
  leaves asserted clauses and other files' alone.

### Tier 2 — Prolog libraries, loaded when asked

`:- use_module(library(NAME)).` The lesson is
`tutorials/library/NN-NAME.pl`.

| library | what it is | lesson |
|---|---|---|
| `json`, `xml`, `html` | a term as a document and back; writers answer CODES, readers take codes or an atom; text is said `str("...")`; html carries CSS | 12, 13, 14 |
| `http`, `httpd`, `websocket` | HTTP/1.1 as a grammar; a server whose pages are clauses (`httpd_serve/2,3`, the hook `httpd_page/3`); RFC 6455, client and server | 15, 16, 49 |
| `template` | text with holes, and the clauses that fill them | 52 |
| `main` | an entry point and its argv: `main/0`, `argv_options/3` | 38 |
| `kbs` | many knowledge bases driven from one script | 34 |
| `cowork` | a crew of worker threads that outlives the turn | 42 |
| `ca` | a certificate authority as rules, over `x509` | 27 |
| `astar`, `hex` | shortest paths over a graph of goals; hexagonal-grid arithmetic | 31, 30 |
| `llm` | a language model as a goal: `llm_chat/2,3`, `llm_stream/3`, `llm_embed/3`, over `curl` and `json`. The key is read from the environment, never written in a file or a term | 36 |
| `clay_ray` | Clay's render commands drawn with `ray` | 47 |
| `tensor_expr` | tensors as expressions over `torch` or `tensorflow` | §7, 39 |
| `flow/chart`, `flow/debug` | a predicate drawn; a query explained | §8, §9, 50, 51 |
| `reasoning/reason`, `normalise`, `tagger`, `translate` | controlled English into predicates, and a translator between the lessons' languages; a version of its own | 43 to 46 |

### Tier 2 — loadable modules

`:- use_module(library(NAME)).` loads `library/NAME.so`, built by
`sh modules/NAME/build.sh` or all at once by `make modules`. The suite and
the lessons load them and do not build them: a missing `.so` is a missing
library, said at load.

| module | gives | needs |
|---|---|---|
| `stream` | ISO streams: `open/3,4 close/1 read_term/2,3 get_char/1,2 put_char/1,2 format/3 on a stream set_output/1 stream_property/2 ...` | nothing |
| `process` | `sh/1,2 shl/1,2 proc_run/4 proc_spawn/2 proc_wait/3 proc_stop/1`, and the suite's `check/3 checks_done/0` | nothing |
| `thread` | `thread_create/2 thread_join/2`, channels, mutexes, conditions (§6) | nothing |
| `tcp` | `tcp_listen/2 tcp_accept/2 tcp_connect/2 tcp_read/2 tcp_write/2 tcp_close/1`; `unix(Path)` where a port stands | nothing |
| `os`, `signal`, `text` | `os_is/1 os_cpus/1 os_tmp/1 os_which/2 ...`; `on_signal/3`; `re_match/2 re_replace/4 head_lines/3 ...` | nothing |
| `regex` | PCRE2: `rx_match/2 rx_first/3 rx_all/3 rx_replace/4 rx_split/3 rx_named/4` | libpcre2 |
| `curl` | an HTTP client: `curl_get/3 curl_post/5 curl_request/5` | libcurl |
| `sha`, `aes`, `der`, `x509`, `tls`, `bigint` | hashes and HMAC, AES, DER, certificates, TLS sockets, arbitrary-precision integers | a built ZiguratIP |
| `torch`, `tensorflow` | the `tensor_*` and `model_*` predicates (§7) | libtorch; TensorFlow's C library |
| `numpy` | `np_*` arrays (opt-in, embeds CPython) | python3 with numpy |
| `opencv` | `cv_*`: images, features, dnn | OpenCV 4 |
| `ray`, `clay` | raylib's 2D, 3D and input; a user interface as a term laid out by Clay | raylib; nothing |

**The exact surface of a library is its file's header**: `library/NAME.pl`,
or `modules/NAME/NAME.cicili` for a module. Its lesson shows it used.
`make index` writes `tools/cocolint/surface.jsonl`, one JSON object a library
with its header and its documented predicates, which is the quickest thing to
search.

## 5. The knowledge base

Nothing above the store knows which arrangement it runs in. `assertz/1` is
`assertz/1` in all four; what differs is whether the clause outlives the
process and who else can see it.

| option | the store | who sees a write |
|---|---|---|
| `--local` (the default) | memory | this process, until it ends |
| `--embed [DIR]` | ZiguratIP's storage engine in this process, over a directory (`./KB`) | every later process that opens DIR; one process at a time, the others wait their turn |
| `--kb NAME --host H --tcp [PORT]`, `--tls [PORT]` | a ZiguratIP server | every process on that knowledge base |
| `--http [PORT]`, `--https [PORT]` | Zeytun, read only | nobody: it only reads |

```sh
./cocolog --embed /tmp/kb run shop.pl 'assertz(shop_seen(today))'
./cocolog --embed /tmp/kb query 'shop_seen(X), shop_price(apple, P)'   # a second process
./cocolog --embed /tmp/kb forget shop_seen 1                           # drop one predicate
./cocolog --embed /tmp/kb vacuum                                       # reclaim dead rows
```

- With a store, `run FILE` writes the file's clauses into it and `-s FILE`
  does not. A tool run with `run` against a real knowledge base leaves its own
  source in the database.
- Each finished goal is one committed transaction. `library(zigurat)`'s
  predicates steer it from inside: `zigurat_begin/0`, `zigurat_commit/0`,
  `zigurat_rollback/0`, `zigurat_isolation/1`. Under `--local` they raise.
- A writing process rewrites the whole predicate and the old rows stay dead
  until `vacuum`. A store that has grown slow wants a vacuum.
- The first call of a predicate fetches all its clauses. A predicate the store
  cannot read raises `resource_error(knowledge_base)`.
- A store is in the writing machine's byte order and does not travel.
- Lesson: `tutorials/basics/11-the-knowledge-base.pl`.

## 6. Threads and green threads

Two models. Choose by what must be shared.

| | `library(async)` — green threads | `library(thread)` — OS threads |
|---|---|---|
| load | nothing: tier 1 | `:- use_module(library(thread)).` |
| shares | ONE store with its caller: a task sees and writes the program's clauses | nothing: a machine, a store and a connection of its own |
| sees | everything the caller sees | every registered module; nothing the parent asserted or consulted |
| passes terms | `async_run/2`'s result, `await/2`, channels: each a copy | channels and `thread_join/2`: each a copy |
| scheduling | one worker a core, a task preempted every 10 000 steps | the kernel's |

```prolog
conc_square(X, Y) :- Y is X * X.

conc_green(Got) :-
    async_run(( channel(C),
                go(( conc_square(3, Y), channel_send(C, Y), channel_close(C) )),
                channel_recv(C, _) ), Answer),
    Answer = (_, _, channel_recv(_, Got)).        % Got = 9

conc_os(Status) :-                                % Status = true
    thread_create(conc_square(5, _), Id),
    thread_join(Id, Status).
```

- **A result is a copy.** The variables of the goal given to `async_run/2`,
  `go/2` or `thread_create/2` are not bound in the caller. Read the answer
  from `async_run/2`'s second argument (the goal as instantiated), from
  `await(Id, Result)`, or from a channel.
- **An OS thread sees modules, not consulted clauses.** `conc_os/1` above
  answers `true` under `cocolog -s FILE`. Under `cocolog run FILE` its Status
  is `error('uncaught exception: ...')` around
  `existence_error(procedure, conc_square/2)`: a thread's store starts empty
  and is filled from the module registry. Load the program with `-s` or
  `use_module`, before the first thread starts. The same holds for an httpd
  pool: a page consulted or asserted is a 404 in a worker.
- Green tasks run under `async_run/1,2` only: `go/1,2`, `yield/0`,
  `await/1,2`, `await_all/1`, `channel/1,2`, `channel_send/2`,
  `channel_recv/2` (fails on a closed, empty channel), `channel_close/1`,
  `async_workers/1`. A task that fails makes `await` fail; one that throws
  makes it throw; every task blocked is `resource_error(deadlock)` at
  `async_run`.
- A store write in a green world stops every worker while it lands. Write
  seldom, and do the first call of each predicate before the world starts.
- Size work from `async_workers/1`, never from a number: a machine may have
  three cores.
- Mutexes and conditions (`with_mutex/2`) serialise the world outside — a
  file, a socket, the terminal — not terms.
- Lessons 18 and 54; `library/async/README.md` has the model and its limits.

## 7. `library(tensor_expr)` — tensors as expressions

```prolog
:- use_module(library(tensor_expr)).    % loads library(torch), lends the operators
```

An expression names a tensor. `T := Expr` runs it and frees every
intermediate, so only the result is left to free:

```prolog
L := mean((X matmul W + B - Y) ^ 2.0)
```

**A float is a number; an integer is a handle.** `A * 2.0` scales A, `A * 2`
multiplies by the tensor whose handle is 2. Write `2.0`.

| form | meaning |
|---|---|
| `A matmul B`, `A + B  A - B  A * B  A / B` | binary, elementwise but for `matmul` |
| `A + 1.5`, `A ^ 2.0`, `1.5 - A`, `2.0 / A` | with a float scalar |
| `- A`, `relu(A) sigmoid(A) tanh(A) exp(A) log(A) sqrt(A) abs(A) transpose(A)` | unary; each is a prefix operator too (`relu A`) |
| `mean(A) sum(A) max(A) min(A) std(A)` | a one-element TENSOR, so it differentiates |
| `[[1.0], [2.0]]`, `zeros(S) ones(S) randn(S) rand(S) full(S, V) eye(N) arange(N) randperm(N) csv(Path)` | leaves; S is a shape list |
| `reshape(A, S) cat([A, B], Dim) argmax(A, Dim) rows(A, From, To) cols(A, From, To) standardise(A, N) index_rows(A, I)` | shape and selection |
| `parameter(A)` | a fresh leaf that requires gradient, with A's values |
| `step(W, G, LR)` | `W - LR*G` as a NEW leaf: a step makes a parameter, not a node |
| `glorot(R, C)` | `randn([R, C])` scaled; wrap it in `parameter(...)` |
| `softmax(A) log_softmax(A) layer_norm(A) gelu(A) row_sum(A) row_mean(A) mean_rows(A, L)` | row-wise composites |
| `conv2d(A, K, Shifts) pool2(A, P) up2(A, U)` | pictures as rows `[N*H*W, Cin]`; the helpers come from `shifts/3`, `pool_matrix/3`, `up_matrix/3` (or `taps/4`, `pool_taps/4`, `up_taps/4` for large pictures) |
| `cross_entropy(Logits, OneHot) bce(P, Y) mse(P, Y)` | losses, the mean over rows |
| `loss(X, Y, W, B)` after `loss(X, Y, W, B) ::= mse(X matmul W + B, Y).` | a function the program defined with `::=`, used by name |

The **answers** stand outermost on the right of `:=` and give a Prolog term,
never a handle to free:

| form | answers |
|---|---|
| `L := list(E)`, `V := item(E)`, `S := shape(E)` | nested lists; the one number; the shape |
| `V := reduce(mean, E)` | a NUMBER: `sum mean max min std` |
| `Gs := grad(E, Ps)` | one gradient for each parameter handle in Ps |
| `Tr-Te := split(E, N)` | a train and a test part |
| `Ps := params(Name)` | the parameters saved under Name, as parameters |
| `T := force(E)`, `S := stats` | compute now under graph mode; the graph's statistics |

### A procedure is a grammar rule

A rule whose body is `Var = Expr` bindings is a procedure: each binding runs
through `:=`, and `exec/1` frees every tensor the rule made that its head does
not return. A plain goal goes in braces. This is the shape of all forty-two
tutorials (`tutorials/tensor/01-linear-regression.pl`):

```prolog
:- use_module(library(tensor_expr)).

loss(X, Y, W, B) ::= mse(X matmul W + B, Y).

parameters([W, B]) :-
    W := parameter(randn([1, 1])),
    B := parameter(zeros([1])).

train :- exec(train).
train -->
    seed(1),
    lin_data(64, X, Y),                              % another procedure
    { parameters(Ps0), fit(200, Ps0, X, Y, [W, B]) },
    L = item(loss(X, Y, W, B)),
    { format("final mse ~4f~n", [L]) },
    params_save(t01_linreg, [W, B]).

fit(0, Ps, _, _, Ps) :- !.
fit(K, [W, B], X, Y, PsF) :-
    L := loss(X, Y, W, B),
    Gs := grad(L, [W, B]),
    sgd_step([W, B], Gs, 0.2, Ps2),                  % frees W, B and Gs
    tensor_free(L),
    K1 is K - 1,
    fit(K1, Ps2, X, Y, PsF).

predict :- exec(predict).
predict -->
    [W, B] = params(t01_linreg),
    Out = list([[0.5]] matmul W + B),
    { format("~w~n", [Out]) }.
```

**The one discipline: a rule frees nothing by hand.**

- `tensor_free/1`, `free_all/1`, `sgd_step/4` and `adam_step/6` free what they
  are given, so they are predicates, never written in a rule. The loop that
  steps an optimiser is a predicate (`fit/5` above); its forward pass may be a
  procedure.
- Parameters are made in that predicate and brought in through braces:
  `{ parameters(Ps0), fit(..., Ps0, Ps) }`. Written as `W0 = parameter(...)`
  in the rule, `W0` would be freed by the optimiser's first step and again by
  `exec/1`: the goal fails after its last print, and a store it meant to save
  into is never committed.
- Inside a rule `=` is the binding. A plain unification goes in braces.
- Usable in a rule without braces: `seed/1`, `tensor_execution/1,2,3` (to set),
  `torch_device/1`, the `model_*` predicates, `params_save/2`, `params_load/2`,
  `one_hot/3`, `accuracy/3`, `block_mask/3`, `causal_mask/3`, `shifts/3`,
  `pool_matrix/3`, `up_matrix/3`, `taps/4`, `pool_taps/4`, `up_taps/4`.

### Predicates, backends, running

- Optimisers: `sgd_step(+Ps, +Gs, +LR, -Ps2)`; `adam_init(+Ps, -State)`,
  `adam_init(+Ps, [beta1(B)], -State)`,
  `adam_step(+Ps, +Gs, +State, +LR, -Ps2, -State2)`.
- `params_save(+Name, +Ps)` writes the parameters as TERMS into the knowledge
  base; `params_load(+Name, -Ps)` (or `params(Name)` in an expression) reads
  them. Handles are integers local to a process; terms are what the next
  process loads. So each tutorial has three goals, `train`, `test` and
  `predict`, and each is its own process over one store:

  ```sh
  ./cocolog --embed /tmp/t run tutorials/tensor/01-linear-regression.pl train
  ./cocolog --embed /tmp/t run tutorials/tensor/01-linear-regression.pl test
  ./cocolog --embed /tmp/t run tutorials/tensor/01-linear-regression.pl predict
  ```

- **Two backends, one grammar.** The file never names its backend; set it
  from outside: `tensor_execution(torch | tensorflow, eager | graph)`, with a
  third argument `cpu | cuda | auto` for the device.

  ```sh
  ./cocolog --embed /tmp/t run tutorials/tensor/32-resnet.pl \
      "tensor_execution(tensorflow, graph), train"
  ```

- The layer underneath is `library(torch)`: `tensor_*` predicates over
  handles, and whole models as terms — `model_new(+Spec, -M)` with layers
  `input(N) dense(W, Act) conv(...) pool(...) flatten dropout(P) norm
  embedding(V, D) lstm(H) attention(H) ...`, `model_train/4`,
  `model_predict/3`, `model_evaluate/5`, `model_save/2`, `model_load/2`
  (`modules/torch/README.md`, lesson 22).
- A bad expression raises `error(domain_error(tensor_expression, E), _)`; an
  unbound one, `error(instantiation_error, _)`.
- To add a form, add an `expr//2` clause in your own file: it is an extension
  point.
- Needs `library/torch.so` (`sh modules/torch/build.sh`, with libtorch) or
  `library/tensorflow.so`. Without one the load says so. References:
  `library/tensor_expr.pl`'s header, `tutorials/tensor/README.md` (the
  forty-two networks, linear regression to object detection), lesson 39.

## 8. `library(flow/chart)` — what a predicate can do

A flowchart of a predicate, from the query down to the C it reaches.
**Nothing is run**: the program is read and analysed for one call pattern.
It writes `BASE.svg` for a person and `BASE.xml` for an agent, one graph with
shared ids.

```sh
./cocolog -s tools/flow/chart.pl -- SPEC FILE BASE [OPTION ...]
./cocolog -s tools/flow/chart.pl -- 'f_show(+)' faults.pl out/faults
```

```
out/faults.svg
out/faults.xml
faults.pl:5:29: error: f_show/1: f_print/1 is defined nowhere: no clause, builtin, module or dynamic declaration answers it, so this call raises existence_error [unknown_procedure p1.c1.g2]
faults.pl:3:23: error: f_total/2: S0 is free on every path to here, and is/2 evaluates it: this call raises an instantiation error [instantiation p2.c2.g1]
```

- **SPEC** is a call pattern, `report(+, -)`, with `+` bound, `-` free and `?`
  either; or `Name/Arity` (every argument `?`); or `Name//Arity` for a
  nonterminal.
- **Exit status**: 0 both files written, 1 no such predicate, 2 anything else,
  with the reason on stderr. A finding is not a failure of the command. The
  directory of BASE must exist.
- **Options**: `libraries=none|reach|all`, `depth=N|all` and
  `only=NAME/ARITY,...` (what the picture shows; the XML is never pruned),
  `load=FILE,library(NAME),...` (the program's other files, whose predicates
  then count as defined), `modules=SRC.cicili,...` (a program's own modules),
  `title=TEXT`, `progress=S`.
- **Findings**, each one line as a compiler writes it, a `<finding>` at the
  head of the XML, and a red disc on its box: a call nothing answers (with the
  name it probably meant); an argument free where the engine refuses one;
  left recursion; a clause never tried; a `%! p(...) is det` the code does not
  keep; a predicate's clauses not together, or defined twice; a thread never
  joined; a lock kept on a way out.
- **The XML says what the picture does**: every goal with its file, line and
  column, its modes, `can_fail`, `choice`, the panel it calls and `on_fail`
  (the id of the goal tried again, `next_clause`, or `fail`). Ids are shared
  with the SVG: panel `p3`, clause `p3.c2`, goal `p3.c2.g4`.
- From Prolog (`:- use_module(library(flow/chart)).`):
  `flow_chart(+Spec, +Base, +Options)` with `source(File)` required,
  `flow_graph(+Spec, -Graph, +Options)`, `flow_findings(+Graph, -Findings)`,
  `flow_svg/2`, `flow_xml/2`. A finding is `finding(N, Kind, Severity, At, In,
  where(File, Line, Col), Text, See)`.
- It needs `library/stream.so` and `library/flow/tables.pl`, which
  `make modules` writes. **After adding a C builtin, give it a line in
  `library/flow/modes.pl` and run `sh tools/flow/build.sh`**: the chart reads
  its modes from there, and `test/flowchart.pl` holds the two together.
- A large program takes time: the translator (1 066 predicates) charts in
  about fifty seconds. Lesson 50.

Use it before running anything: a chart of the entry predicate finds the
misspelt call and the unbound `is/2` without a test.

## 9. `library(flow/debug)` — what a query did

```sh
./cocolog -s tools/flow/debug.pl -- GOAL FILE BASE [OPTION ...]
./cocolog -s tools/flow/debug.pl -- 'shop_order([apple-1, pear-1], T)' shop.pl out/shop txt=true
```

```
out/shop.svg
out/shop.xml
out/shop.txt
shop_order([apple - 1, pear - 1], T): false at step 11; recorded 1 to 11; diverged no; ...
```

The program runs twice, each time in a child process that reads it afresh: a
**probe** at full speed learns how the run ends and at which step, and a
**replay** records a window of steps. Nothing slows the run being explained.
`BASE.svg` draws the path over the flowchart (reached boxes heavy, failed red,
raised purple); `BASE.xml` holds the same as `<call>`, `<event>` and `<why>`.
`txt=true` writes `BASE.txt`, one line a call, which is the form to read:

```
1 shop_order([apple-1,pear-1],_G22) fail [c2] query.g1
2   shop_buy(apple,1,_G410) exit shop_buy(apple,1,3) [c1] p1.c2.g1 :16:5
...
8     shop_buy(pear,1,_G505) fail [c1] p1.c2.g1 :16:5
10       shop_stock(pear,_G539) exit shop_stock(pear,0) [c2] p2.c1.g2 :10:5
11       >=(0,1) fail [] p2.c1.g3 :11:5
% where it got furthest:
%  shop_order([apple-1,pear-1],_G22): clause 2, the furthest of 1 tried: 1 of its calls exited (call 1)
%      shop_buy(pear,1,_G505): clause 1, the furthest of 1 tried: 2 of its calls exited (call 8)
%        >=(0,1): failed, nothing of the program's to say why (call 11)
```

Each line is `STEP INDENT GOAL FATE [CLAUSES] BOX WHERE`. The indent is the
depth, two spaces a level. `cK` is a clause entered, `hK` a head that did not
unify. `pP.cK.gN` names the clause the call was made in, `:LINE:COL` where.

- **The unit is the step**, one a goal. `statistics/2` counts inferences, the
  steps less each `true` and `=/2`.
- **Exit status**: 0 the run was recorded, 1 the program has no such
  predicate, 2 anything else. A run that failed or threw is not a failure of
  the command.
- **Debug the entry goal.** Each child starts afresh, so a goal from the
  middle of a program lacks the globals and facts an earlier call set.
- **Record the whole run.** The window is the last 2 000 steps by default,
  whose why is only the last fallbacks. The first run says `false at step N`:
  run it again with `from=1 to=N`, and the foot of `BASE.txt` then says where
  each failed call got furthest, down to the call it failed at.
- **The furthest path can name a scan.** It ranks a clause by the calls of its
  body that exited. A clause that walks every position with `append/3` and
  tests each beats the clauses that did the work, and has read nothing. When
  the path ends in such a clause, rank the clauses by the steps they spent and
  read the arguments on the way.
- **A whole-run record is held in memory**, about 6 KB a step: 1.5 million
  steps took 8.8 GB and seven minutes. For a longer run, debug the entry goal
  over a shorter input, or take windows.

| option | does |
|---|---|
| `txt=true`, `svg=false`, `xml=false` | write `BASE.txt`; leave a document out |
| `window=N`, `from=I to=J` | the last N steps; or exactly these |
| `until=end\|answer(K)` | stop at the end, or at the K-th answer |
| `text=N` | write arguments whole up to N characters (a long one is cut, `...[318]`) |
| `when=COND` (`step=N`) | not how the run went but WHEN: the first step at which COND, a goal over GOAL's variables, holds. `when=nonvar(T)` answers `first holds at step 15` |
| `profile=all` | `BASE.prof`: steps by predicate, inclusive and self, the callers, the goals asked more than once, and where the TIME went. `profile=run` times the whole run |
| `windows=N jobs=J` | N windows along one run, J at a time, their profiles added up |
| `diff=FILE_B`, `diff_goal=GOAL_B` | two runs compared: the calls both made that answered differently, deepest first (`BASE.diff`) |
| `journal=true` | the probe journals every call that reaches the world — clock, file, process, thread — and the replay is answered from the journal and runs none of them |
| `cache=DIR` | keep the program's chart (a big program's chart is most of the time; needs `library/sha.so`) |
| `embed=DIR kb=NAME` | run over a store. What the run writes is written: debug against a copy |
| `own=all\|FILE,...` | explain the failed calls of every predicate, not only the chart's panels |

- A replay that does not end where the probe did — the program read the time,
  a file, the knowledge base — is said to have **diverged**. `journal=true`
  takes that away.
- From Prolog (`:- use_module(library(flow/debug)).`):
  `flow_debug(+Goal, +Base, +Options, -Run)` with `source(File)` required;
  `flow_why(+Run, -Whys)`, `flow_why_furthest/2`, `flow_why_raised/2,3` (why it
  raised: the calls the exception ended, the branch that chose it);
  `flow_when(+Goal, +Cond, +Options, -When)`; `flow_diff/3`;
  `flow_run_end/3`, `flow_run_time/3`; `flow_debug_windows/4` with
  `flow_profile_merge/4,5`. Run is `run(How, At, Answers, window(From, To),
  Calls, Bindings, Diverged, Journal)`, and How is `answer`, `false`, `limit`,
  `exception(Ball)`, `halt(Code)`, `error(Message)` or
  `diverged(I, Want, Got)`.
- Lesson 51; `library/flow/debug.pl`'s header is the reference.

**To find a cost**: `profile=all` over a few windows spread along the run,
rank the predicates by calls, then by callers, then read the repeats. A count
finds the cheap step taken a million times; `profile=time` finds the one step
that costs a thousand.

## 10. Tracing and backtraces

- An uncaught error prints its message, then `ERROR: In:` with the goal that
  raised and the goals left to run. `--backtrace` prints every call it was
  raised in instead, as `[Depth] Goal` (the run is slower). `--no-backtrace`
  prints the message alone.
- `--trace`, or `trace/0` and `notrace/0` from inside, prints swipl's four
  ports on stderr. It hides what swipl's hides: a library predicate shows its
  own call, not its helpers.
- `statistics(inferences, N)`, `call_metered/4` and `statistics(cputime, T)`
  measure from inside.
- [`TRACING.md`](TRACING.md) has the ports, the inference clock, a recorded
  window and the journal.

## 11. cocolint

```sh
sh tools/cocolint/lint.sh FILE.pl ...     # exit 1 on a HARD finding
sh tools/cocolint/lint.sh --auto          # every changed .pl, and the dialect card
make lint FILES=FILE.pl
```

```
port.pl:3:1 HARD N1 `append/3' is already defined by lib/lists.cicili. Consult APPENDS, so the two sets of clauses merge ...
    fix: prefix it ...
port.pl:5:9 HARD S1 [X3] Deliberately absent so ported code errors instead of silently differing ...
cocolint: 2 HARD, 1 WARN over 1 file(s)
```

| rule | fires on |
|---|---|
| N1, N2, N3 | a head that collides with a library's clauses; with a loaded module's C name (dead code); with a control construct |
| S1 | a banned form of the dialect card: `:- table`, `error(T, context(_, _))`, `'[\|]'`, stream predicates without `library(stream)`, `predsort/3` and its kin, a flag that does not answer |
| T1, Z1 | `use_module` of a tier-1 library; a clause too long for a page |
| U1 | an acknowledgement that excuses nothing |

- A form committed on purpose carries `% cocolint: ID -- why` on its line, or
  alone on the line before. The reason is required.
- **The whole tree lints clean, and `test/lint.pl` holds it to that.** Lint
  every new or changed `.pl` before a commit.
- **cocolint cuts a file into clauses with a scanner of its own.** A clause
  that does not read lints clean. A load's stderr is what finds it (§3).
- The dialect card cites engine lines. After touching `lib/` or
  `cocolog.cicili`: `sh tools/cocolint/tool.sh card --check`.

## 12. A lesson, a suite case

- **A lesson is a test.** Every claim is a `must(Label, Got, Want)`; the
  helper is repeated at the foot of each file so a lesson can be copied
  anywhere; the last line a lesson prints is exactly `done`. Run one as the
  suite does:

  ```sh
  COCOLOG_LIBRARY=$PWD/library ./cocolog run tutorials/library/12-json.pl main
  ```

  (A lesson run with `-s` is a module: a thread it starts loads it again.)
- **A new library gets a lesson in the same commit**:
  `tutorials/library/NN-name.pl`.
- **A suite case is `test/NAME.pl`**, run from the checkout root as
  `./cocolog -s test/NAME.pl`. `main/0` runs the checks, `check/3` and
  `checks_done/0` are `library(process)`'s, and the exit status is the
  verdict. `test/prelude.pl` has the helpers (`answer/3`, `cocolog_out/2`,
  `scratch/1`, `skip/1`, `spawn/2`). A check is a second process only when it
  must be. Add the case to `pl_names/1` in `test/run.pl`.
- **A swipl-compatibility case is `test/files/NAME.pl`**: one file run by
  both systems in the same empty directory, the two outputs compared byte for
  byte (`./cocolog -s test/files.pl -- NAME`). It wants the REFERENCE swipl
  9.0.4 and skips by name on any other.
- A clause has one scope: suffix a check's variables with its number, and
  never reuse a suffix.

# Part B — changing cocolog

## 13. Rule zero: Cicili's `lib/`

**Before writing any `(decl) (func …)`, `(struct …)`, `(typedef …)`,
`@define`, C or POSIX binding, or `(code …)`, look in `../cicili/lib/`.**

Cicili already declares the C17 and POSIX headers
([`../cicili/lib/std/c/`](../cicili/lib/std/c)), the standard containers
([`../cicili/lib/std/`](../cicili/lib/std)), and the bindings under `db`,
`net`, `python`, `cpp` and `parsi`. Import the binding, include the real
header, add the link flags. Do not copy a declaration from a header or from
another project. What is usually missing is only a C typedef for a struct the
real header leaves untyped — `(@define (code "pollfd struct pollfd"))` — named
exactly as the std declaration names it.

If a declaration is truly missing, it belongs in Cicili's `lib/`, and Cicili
is an input to this repository: that change needs the owner's explicit leave.
What belongs here is cocolog's own seams: `lib/module.cicili` and
`lib/sdk.cicili`, the two backends, and each module's `binding.cicili`.

Read [`../cicili/SKILL.md`](../cicili/SKILL.md) before a line of Cicili. A
wrong guess there compiles to something that fails much later.

## 14. Source map

| path | what lives there |
|---|---|
| [`cocolog.cicili`](cocolog.cicili) | the composition root: the commands, the options, the toplevel, and the version (`coco_version_text`) |
| `lib/term.cicili`, `term-walk` | cells, the machine, text, names, the heap; binding, the trail, unification, copying, cycles, the standard order |
| `lib/syntax.cicili` | the reader and the writer over one operator table; the parser is written once as macros and emitted twice |
| `lib/dcg.cicili` | the grammar translator, `phrase/2,3`, term and goal expansion |
| `lib/kb.cicili`, `kb-compile`, `kb-pred`, `kb-consult` | the clause store and its five backend hooks; compiled clauses, guards, environments; predicates, indexes, the update view, compaction; assert, consult, retract |
| `lib/solve.cicili`, `solve-journal`, `solve-control`, `solve-gc`, `solve-loop`, `solve-arith`, `solve-text`, `solve-db` | the engine: tables and declarations; the journal; continuations, choice points, throwing, error text, the tracer; the collector; the step loop; arithmetic; text; the database, listing and dispatch |
| `lib/builtins.cicili`, `builtins-format`, `builtins-db` | the builtins module: its table and Prolog half; `format` and the character classes; the database half and the dispatcher |
| `lib/lists.cicili`, `apply`, `files`, `library` | `library(lists)`, `library(apply)`, the Files library; `use_module` and the library path |
| `lib/swipl-ctype.cicili`, `swipl-det`, `swipl-props`, `swipl-system` | tables GENERATED under the reference swipl by `tools/ctype`, `tools/det`, `tools/props`, `tools/dwim`: run the generator again, never edit the table |
| `lib/swipl/` | SWI's eight vendored libraries, unmodified: do not edit |
| `lib/state.cicili` | the frozen machine: freeze and thaw |
| `lib/green.cicili` | the green scheduler: workers, channels, the write barrier |
| `lib/module.cicili`, `lib/sdk.cicili` | the module seam, and the SDK a loadable module is written against |
| `lib/zigurat-kb.cicili`, `zeytun-kb`, `zigurat-mod` | the two remote backends; `library(zigurat)` |
| [`client/`](client), [`embed/`](embed), [`parsi/`](parsi) | the wire client in C (`client/tls.c` the one TLS unit); the embedded store; the schema `make schema` compiles |
| [`modules/`](modules) | the twenty-one loadable modules, one directory each |
| [`library/`](library) | tier-2 Prolog libraries and the built `.so` files; `library/flow/`, `library/reasoning/` |
| [`tools/`](tools) | `cocolint/` the linter; `flow/` chart, debug, `zero.sh`; `cc/` the compiler wrappers; `ci/`, `cloud/` |
| [`test/`](test), [`tutorials/`](tutorials), [`bench/`](bench) | the suite; the lessons; the benchmarks |

**A heavy lib file is pieces of one translation unit.** The head keeps the
tables, the macros and every declaration; a function calls only what an
earlier piece defined or the head declared. A new piece goes into
`cocolog.cicili`'s list and into each test binary's that emits the head, or
its functions are declared and never defined.

## 15. Build

```sh
export CICILI=/path/to/cicili              # a Cicili checkout, 3.3.0 or later
export ZIGURATIP=/path/to/ZiguratIP        # a BUILT ZiguratIP checkout
export ZIGURATIP_HOME=$ZIGURATIP/home
export CL_SOURCE_REGISTRY="$CICILI/:"      # the Cicili that ASDF loads
export PATH=$PWD/tools/cc:$PATH            # clang, through the wrappers
make                    # the client and the one binary, embedded store linked in
make EMBED=0            # the same binary with no ZiguratIP
make modules            # every module this box can build, and the flow tables
make schema             # the Parsi objects into $ZIGURATIP_HOME
make index              # cocolint's blocklist and retrieval index
make lint FILES=x.pl
make test               # the suite: ask the owner first
```

- **Everything is built by clang, in release mode.** Cicili names `gcc`, so
  `tools/cc` comes first on PATH and hands over to clang. Check an object, not
  the command: `readelf -p .comment .libs/cocolog.o` names clang.
- **`CICILI` does not choose the Cicili that runs; ASDF does.**
  `cicili.lisp` loads the first `cicili.asd` in ASDF's registry, and
  `~/common-lisp/cicili` usually answers first. Set `CL_SOURCE_REGISTRY` to
  the checkout meant, and ask before trusting a build:
  `cd "$CICILI" && sbcl --script cicili.lisp --version`.
- This tree needs Cicili 3.3.0 or later (`stat`'s file times; `(cold)`;
  `realpath`). An older one stops at `unknown member: st_mtim` or `unknown
  symbol: cold`.
- A missing ZiguratIP fails in Cicili with
  `FILE-DOES-NOT-EXIST … embed/mvccs-lib.cicili`. A test binary that links the
  engine takes about a hundred seconds to build.
- Cicili treats compiler chatter as fatal: an `Unhandled SIMPLE-ERROR` whose
  text is a warning is a warning to silence in the target's own `:compile`
  list.
- **After a new Cicili or a ZiguratIP change, rebuild in order**: ZiguratIP,
  then here `make clean && make`, `make schema`, `make modules`. A stale Parsi
  object takes the server down with `symbol lookup error`.
- On a Mac whose compiler is Homebrew's LLVM and whose binary needs Z3 through
  libCore, the build may need
  `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/z3/5.1.0/lib
  CICILI_CC=/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang
  CICILI_CXX=/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang++ make`. `CLAUDE.md`'s macOS
  section has the rest.
- **Never commit build output**: `.o`, `.so`, the C that Cicili emits, the
  `sdk.cicili` and `zigheaders` links in `modules/*`. The test is to delete
  everything a `build.sh` makes and run it: what comes back was output.

## 16. The suite, and proving a change

`make test` is `./cocolog -s test/run.pl`: 77 lines, seven Cicili test
binaries (term, syntax, solve, module, state, zigurat, shared) and seventy
Prolog cases, each with its seconds.

```sh
./cocolog -s test/run.pl -- lint          # one case through the runner
./cocolog -s test/engine.pl               # a case alone, from the checkout root
./cocolog -s test/files.pl -- op_reduce   # one file of the swipl comparison
```

- **Ask the owner before the full suite, a gate, or a whole tutorial run.**
  Prove a change with narrow cases; say what was run and what was not.
- **The lint case first**, so a card citation that the edit moved is settled
  before a long run. **A red case that was fixed is rerun alone**, not with
  the suite.
- **`red: 0` is not a pass.** Database cases SKIP with no server, and others
  for a missing tool: `files` and `trace` want swipl 9.0.4, `ray` a screen,
  the tensor cases their libraries. Count the SKIPs, read their reasons, and
  run `pgrep ziguratip`.
- The suite loads `library/*.so` and does not build them: `make modules` after
  a pull.
- A server is raised detached, with its libraries on the path (`CLAUDE.md`,
  "Running a program"). A plain `nohup … &` from a tool call does not survive
  the turn.
- A case that passes alone proves the case; the suite proves the contract
  between cases.

**The method for a swipl-compatibility change**, which is most changes here:

1. Probe swipl 9.0.4 over the shapes, odd ones included. Its answers are the
   specification.
2. Write them as `test/files/NAME.pl`, a file both systems run.
3. Fix the engine. Extend a table rather than the code it generates.
4. **One rule, one arm**: for each rule of the fix, a build with that rule
   alone taken out must turn the case red. A guard whose arm stays green
   proves nothing, and is taken out or kept only for a measured cost.
5. Narrow cases, the lint case, the card check.
6. Count the cost (§18).
7. Write it down: a bullet in `CLAUDE.md` where the next session will trip, a
   row in `COMPAT.md` for what still differs, a section in `STATUS.md` with
   the numbers. Bump the version in the same commit (§19).

## 17. The engine: what must stay true

- **Flat cells, no pointers in terms.** A term is a cell index. The
  continuation is the term `'$k'(Goal, Barrier, Rest)`; choice points are
  integer frames. Freezing a machine is writing its arrays.
- **Dispatch is construct, C builtin, module, store, by name and arity.** A
  program file's clause for a builtin's name takes it over.
- **Add to the table, never to the generated code.** The tables emit several
  things that must not drift apart: `*builtins*`, `*operators*`,
  `*arith-names*`, `*functor-names*`, `*construct-names*`, `*error-contexts*`,
  `*frame-contexts*`, `*wt-options*`, `*coco-ct-classes*`.
- **A new C builtin wants four things**: its row; an `*error-contexts*` row,
  or its errors name nothing; a line in `library/flow/modes.pl`; and
  `make modules` and `make index` afterwards, so the flow tables and the
  linter's blocklist know it. A new library helper wants a `*frame-contexts*`
  row under swipl's name for it.
- **A builtin raises swipl's error through `coco_raise`**, catchably. What a
  `coco_m_*_error` returns is the predicate's ANSWER (2), not a status: pass
  it through, never test `not`.
- **Read text through `coco_tx_get`**, an integer through `coco-is-int` and
  `coco_int_val`, build one with `coco_new_int`. Compare floats with
  `coco_flt_eq`. Ask `coco_is_nil`, never `strcmp` with `"[]"`.
- **A cell index held across a step is a root** the collector must be told
  (`coco_heap_root_push`, `coco_store_root_push`). The store's compaction
  moves cells.
- **A new field of the machine is appended**, never inserted: a field in the
  middle moves every offset after it.
- **The step loop is measured, not reasoned about.** A branch, a call, a lock
  or a `defer` added to anything it reaches can move its registers. Slow paths
  go out of line (`(weak) (cold)`); count before and after (§18).
- **The logical update view**: a call sees the clauses that stood when it
  began. A reader of the clause list skips the dead; a writer of the counts
  calls `coco_pred_nprobe`.
- **A feature that touches the knowledge base must consider all three
  arrangements**: local (no hooks), Zigurat (all five), Zeytun (`fetch` and
  `warm` only).

`CLAUDE.md`'s section "The engine: what is not obvious" has one bullet for
each mechanism. **Grep it for the function's name before changing the
function**: each bullet is there because its fact has already cost a day.

### The store and the green world

- `library(async)` runs green tasks over **one shared store**, one worker a
  core, each task a machine of its own, preempted every 10 000 steps.
- A store write takes the **write barrier**: every other worker acknowledges
  at a safe point, the writer changes the store with no lock held, and the
  world goes on. Writes are dear and reads run in parallel. Every piece of
  metadata a first call makes — a predicate created, a clause compiled, an
  index built — is a write too.
- A blocking C call that touches no store declares itself
  (`coco_g_foreign_begin`/`_end`) and is not waited for; its return syncs with
  a write in flight. A call that touches the store must not declare itself.
- The name tables are shared across the machines of a world: an intern hit
  takes no lock, a miss takes the names mutex, and a growth publishes a new
  array and never frees the old one while the world lives.
- `findall/3`'s results and a caught ball live in **private per-engine
  stores**; their puts skip the barrier. Only a ball no catch takes is copied
  to the shared store.
- The nested engine behind `findall/3`, `forall/2` and `call_limited/3` cannot
  suspend its C search: a blocking call inside one waits in the builtin and
  runs the worker's ready tasks, and `yield` there is a no-op.
- No table reclamation and no store compaction runs while a world does.
- `run_isolated/2` gives a proof a fresh store; terms cross only as text,
  never as shared cell indices.

### A loadable module

- One directory under `modules/`: `NAME.cicili`, a `build.sh`, and a
  `binding.cicili` when it binds a library. `sh modules/NAME/build.sh` writes
  `library/NAME.so`, which git ignores.
- It imports **only** `lib/sdk.cicili`, never `lib/module.cicili` beside it,
  and holds the engine as an opaque pointer.
- A C++ module declares the SDK's prototypes with C linkage before
  `(coco-sdk)`. Do not wrap `(coco-sdk)` in `(extern-c …)`.
- A handle is an integer index into the module's own table. A library that
  makes text from wire bytes, or wire bytes from the program's text, crosses
  with `string_bytes/3`, never with `atom_codes/2`.
- A predicate that reaches the world says so (`coco_m_portal`), so that the
  journal can answer it in a replay.
- A `$`-prefixed name is quoted in a module's Prolog half.
- A new module gets its lesson, its row in `make modules`, and its header:
  the header is what `make index` reads. [`MODULES.md`](MODULES.md) is the
  reference.

## 18. Measuring

- `sh tools/flow/zero.sh OLD NEW` counts the untraced engine's instructions on
  naive reverse, queens and lookup, the jump padding apart. The two binaries
  must stand at paths of one length, in sibling directories.
- A start: `valgrind --tool=callgrind ./cocolog query true`. A function's own
  count is callgrind's.
- **A count is not a clock.** Count to find a cost, time to confirm it. This
  box drifts about 20 % between runs of one build: compare two builds in one
  round, alternating, and do not read a ratio under a tenth from ten rounds.
- A count is comparable within one engine, not across two versions of it.
- `statistics/2` is about the calling thread.

## 19. Editing rules

- **Read `CLAUDE.md` first.** Only this repository may be modified unless the
  owner says otherwise; `../cicili` and `../ZiguratIP` are the owner's.
- **Write Prolog in `.pl` and C in `.cicili`.** A module comes from a C or C++
  API declared in a binding and called as Cicili, never from C pasted into
  `(code "...")`.
- **The version moves with the change, in the same commit.** cocolog's is
  `coco_version_text` in `cocolog.cicili`, and README's closing line names it
  too: a patch for any change to the binary or to a library, a minor for
  something new reachable from a program, a major for a program that stops
  working. The
  reasoning library has its own, `reason_version/3` in
  `library/reasoning/reason.pl`, for anything under `library/reasoning/`. Read
  master's number first: two lines of work bump the same one.
- **A documentation-only commit bumps nothing** and says `cocolog stays X.Y.Z`
  in its message.
- **Commit or push only when the owner asks.** Push with
  `git push git@github.com:saman-pasha/cocolog.git master:master`.
- **GitHub's CI only when the owner asks.** `ci.yml` starts on every push to
  master, so a pushed commit's message carries `[skip ci]`; start no run by
  hand and watch none.
- Lint changed `.pl` files, run `sh tools/cocolint/tool.sh card --check` and
  `git diff --check` before a commit.
- **A red case is not a pass.** Rerun it alone; tell a missing optional
  dependency (SKIP) from a regression.
- **Wait for a background job by what it writes** (a `DONE` line in its log),
  never by `pgrep -f` of its script's name: the pattern matches the waiting
  shell's own command line, and the wait never ends.
- `library/` must not change while a reasoning teach or control round runs.
- Never ask for an API key in chat, and never write one into a file: a key is
  read from the environment. A live run of the token benchmark wants the
  owner's go-ahead.

## 20. When something fails

| symptom | start here |
|---|---|
| a predicate is unknown | §2 and §4: is it in a module not loaded, absent on purpose, or a typo? A chart of the caller names the predicate it probably meant (§8) |
| a clause seems missing | the load's stderr (§3): a syntax error drops one clause and goes on |
| an answer differs from swipl's | `COMPAT.md`, then the case in `test/files/` that pins it |
| a goal fails and you do not know where | `tools/flow/debug.pl` with `txt=true` and the whole run recorded (§9) |
| a predicate's clauses are doubled, or some never run | one namespace (§2): `listing(Name/Arity)` shows both sets in the order tried |
| a thread or a pool cannot see the program | it was consulted: load it with `-s` or `use_module` (§6) |
| a green task hangs, or a write stalls | `lib/green.cicili`, `test/async.pl`, the barrier (§17) |
| nothing persists, or a second process sees nothing | `--local` is the default (§5); `-s` writes no clause |
| a slow suite, a `lock wait timeout` | the server's uptime, then `cocolog vacuum` (`CLAUDE.md`, "Hazards") |
| a module will not load or call | `MODULES.md`, the module's `binding.cicili`, `nm -D --defined-only` |
| a build stops with a warning's text | Cicili treats chatter as fatal: the target's `:compile` list (§15) |
| a build behaves like an older Cicili | `sbcl --script cicili.lisp --version`, then `CL_SOURCE_REGISTRY` (§15) |
| the linter's citation drifted | `sh tools/cocolint/tool.sh card --check`; correct the range in `traps.jsonl` |
| a chart calls a builtin unknown | its line in `library/flow/modes.pl`, then `sh tools/flow/build.sh` (§8) |
| a case is SKIP | its own first line says why; report it, do not call it green |

## 21. Before you call it done

For a program:

- [ ] Every predicate you defined has your own prefix; cocolint is clean.
- [ ] The load's stderr is empty of `ERROR` and `Warning`.
- [ ] Text is quoted for what it must be: `'atom'`, or the flag set for strings.
- [ ] It was run the way it will be run: `run` or `-s`, with the store it will
      have.
- [ ] A thread, a pool or a crew gets the program as a module.

For a change to cocolog:

- [ ] `CLAUDE.md` was grepped for the functions touched.
- [ ] The answer is swipl 9.0.4's, held by a `test/files/` case, or
      `COMPAT.md` says how it differs.
- [ ] Each rule has an arm that goes red.
- [ ] Narrow cases, the lint case, the card check; the cost counted.
- [ ] The version, the lesson for a new library, `CLAUDE.md`, `STATUS.md`.
- [ ] No build output in `git status`; nothing run that the owner must be
      asked for.
