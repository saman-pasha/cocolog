%% cocolog tutorial 44 -- library(reasoning/normalise): the grammar as a data generator, and the tags that undo the noise.
%%
%% TIER 2: `use_module(library(reasoning/normalise))', from library/normalise.pl. Clauses only,
%% and it needs nothing but library(reasoning/reason).

%%     cocolog -s tutorials/library/44-normalise.pl
%%
%% THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES. library(reasoning/reason) reads a controlled English and
%% refuses everything else -- tutorial 43 ends on a list of ordinary
%% sentences it will not read. The road from typed prose to that grammar
%% is a network that labels every token: subject, relation, object, or
%% noise. Prolog then rebuilds the sentence in the grammar's shapes and
%% the grammar verifies it. Such a network needs examples, and no corpus
%% of (prose, controlled English) exists -- so this library MAKES one,
%% from the grammar's own shapes: a clean sentence with its gold tags,
%% then noise transforms that carry the tags along.
%%
%% NO NETWORK IS TRAINED HERE. This lesson is about the data: that every
%% clean sentence parses, that every noisy one is refused, and that the
%% gold tags assemble the noisy sentence back into the clean one's terms.
%% That last property is the whole contract -- it is what makes the tags a
%% possible target for a network at all -- and section 4 holds it.
