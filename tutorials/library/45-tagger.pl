%% cocolog tutorial 45 -- library(reasoning/tagger): the network that reads typed text for the grammar.
%%
%% TIER 2: `use_module(library(reasoning/tagger))', from library/reasoning/tagger.pl.
%% Clauses only, over library(tensor_expr) and library(torch) -- and this
%% lesson TRAINS, so it needs library/torch.so built (sh modules/torch/build.sh),
%% and about two minutes on four cores.
%%
%%     cocolog -s tutorials/library/45-tagger.pl
%%
%% THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES. Tutorial 43 ends on prose that
%% library(reasoning/reason) refuses, and tutorial 44 makes the data that
%% could teach a network to label every token -- subject, relation, object,
%% noise -- so that the assembler can rebuild a sentence in the grammar's
%% shapes. This lesson trains that network, in about eighty seconds on four
%% cores with no GPU, and closes the loop: typed prose in, the grammar's
%% terms out, and truth/2 answering questions about them -- and shows the
%% other half, real prose it must not read, refused.
%%
%% THE CORPUS IS THE CAPABILITY. The generator is unbounded in seeds and
%% bounded in variety, and variety is what carries a tagger to words it
%% never saw: fifty-five shapes, thirteen kinds of noise, and a lexicon that is
%% files beside the library -- 2500 census names and some seventeen
%% thousand WordNet words, library/reasoning/lexicon/ -- and 32768 pairs
%% of them by default, over 500 steps. Over that lexicon 8192 pairs read 0.96 of the
%% sentences training never saw whatever the step count, which is
%% memorising; 16384 read 0.987 and 32768 read 0.993: a corpus too large
%% to memorise is what makes a tagger generalise, and the extra pairs cost
%% seconds, because a training is priced by its optimiser steps.
%%
%% NOTHING IS GENERATED. The network never writes a word: it labels the
%% words it was given, the assembler copies them, and the grammar reads the
%% result or refuses it. So a name or a noun the network has never seen is
%% copied into the term, and a wrong label costs a refusal the program can
%% see -- never a sentence that was quietly rewritten. The one thing a tag
%% ADDS is a pair of quotation marks: a word tagged M is a MENTIONED word,
%% and `The noun casa means house', a lesson typed as prose, comes back as
%% the lesson's own line -- section 7 shows it on the shipped model.
